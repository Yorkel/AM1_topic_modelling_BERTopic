BASELINE BERTOPIC MODEL RESULTS
================================

Training Time:
- 4.0 minutes

Model Outputs:
- Topics discovered: 24
- Outlier documents (topic -1): 1183 (29.8%)

Topic Size Distribution:
- Mean topic size: 116.1 documents
- Median topic size: 77.5 documents
- Largest topic: 436 documents
- Smallest topic: 41 documents

Data Coverage:
- Total documents: 3970
- Assigned to topics: 2787 
  (70.2%)

Interpretation:
The baseline model produces a moderate number of interpretable topics with a
non-trivial proportion of outliers. This behaviour is expected under HDBSCAN
and reflects both the heterogeneity of the corpus and the model’s preference
for stable, high-density clusters. Outliers likely represent cross-cutting,
ambiguous, or low-density documents rather than modelling error.

Next Steps:
1. Review topic quality using saved visualisations
2. Inspect representative documents per topic
3. Identify topics for potential merging or splitting
4. Compare topic structure to NMF results
5. Proceed to higher-granularity BERTopic tuning
