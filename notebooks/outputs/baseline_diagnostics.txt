Review these before moving to tuning:

□ Topic Quality:
  - Are topics interpretable from their top words?
  - Do topics represent distinct education policy themes?
  - Are there redundant/overlapping topics?

□ Outlier Rate:
  - Is 29.8% outliers acceptable? (Target: <10%)
  - Review outlier documents - are they genuinely off-topic?

□ Topic Granularity:
  - 24 topics too many/few for your corpus?
  - Compare to your NMF model (30 topics)
  - Should some topics be merged?

□ Coverage by Organisation:
  - Does each organisation have sufficient topic diversity?
  - Are any organisations over/under-represented?

□ Temporal Patterns:
  - Do topics show meaningful evolution over time?
  - Any unexpected spikes or gaps?

□ Representative Documents:
  - Do representative docs match topic labels?
  - Quality check: are they typical of the topic?

NEXT ACTIONS:
Based on diagnostics above, prepare tuning strategy:
1. Target number of topics (consider nr_topics parameter)
2. Min cluster size (if many small topics or high outliers)
3. UMAP/HDBSCAN parameters (for better clustering)
