Here s the full text of her speech Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for being here. And thanks to theCentre for Social Justicefor hosting us. And thanks to Andy. It s great to be back here, this time as education secretary, six months into delivering our plan for change. I know CSJ shares this government s commitment to ensuring that, whoever you are, wherever you come from, ours should be a country where hard work means you don t just get by but you get on. Some of you were here last year, when I started my speech with a story. And today I want to start with a story too: A story about how and why the change I am bringing to the education system matters to me. It s my story. I grew up in the late 80s and early 90s, a shy little girl, from a tough street in the northeast of England, political content removed I never met my dad. It was just me and my mum and my grandparents who lived nearby. We didn t have much. One winter, a neighbour, who himself, he didn t have very much, found out I d been playing outside wearing only a jumper. He put money through the letterbox in an envelope marked for Bridget s coat . Now, not everyone turned to kindness. Crime was a big problem. Our house was burgled time and again. And when my mum reported it to the police, our windows were put out, a man turned up with a baseball bat. It didn t seem like that big a deal at the time. These were just things that happened, and frankly not just to us. I think often of the children I knew then, held back by who they were, by where they were born. So many on my street were denied the opportunity to get on and to succeed. Not because they were lazy, they weren t. They were no less talented than I was, no less ambitious, no less deserving of success. But I was given the opportunities that they were denied. I went to great schools, I was taught by wonderful teachers, I had a family that prized learning. I was in the very first full cohort to sit SATs tests at Key Stage 1, 2 and 3. I benefited from the national curriculum brought in by a political content removed government. My school took up that challenge to push kids like me to achieve. I worked hard, of course I did. But I had the good luck to go to a great school, to have a family who cared deeply about education, a grandfather who to me week in, week out. And like so many stories, this one has a moral lesson at its core. I am proof that the system can work, that a great education can be a transformational force, that background doesn t have to be destiny. That belief formed then, is the core of my politics now. That the promise our children deserve, that hard work is what counts, no matter your background. I believe in that promise, in making that dream real. But I saw so many of my friends from my area let down, let down by a system that lacked a restless ambition for their futures, content, too often, to deliver a mediocre education, middling, in schools that drifted, an education that was seen as just fine for these kids . For kids like me. Michael Gove used to call this the soft bigotry of low expectations and with good reason: he was right. But I don t need to be told about that. I grew up with it all around me, in my community, holding back my friends. I don t forget. Not now. Not ever. It s these memories of those injustices, the doors closed, the dreams stifled, the futures denied, that s what drives me forward in this job. I get up every morning to right those wrongs. To break down the barriers to opportunity for each and every child. Background wasn t my destiny. And I won t rest until that is true for all children. That is my vision for education. Opportunity, for those children, for all children. That is our mission, driven by the prime minister s Plan for Change. An excellent teacher for every child, a high-quality curriculum for every school, a core offer of excellence for every parent. Raising a floor of high standards, below which schools must not slip, above which schools can and must innovate, with no ceiling. Now, those memories are from a long time ago. And in the decades since, standards in England s schools have risen, and millions of children have benefited. Our system now has many strengths, to build into that core. The greater use of evidence in classrooms across the country. No flying blind, guided only by tradition. Now, what matters is what works political content removed reformed exams rigour, challenge. Our national curriculum, a national strength, one from which we will build. Raising the floor, removing the ceiling. Take one example, one that matters immensely. Every child learns about the Holocaust, thanks to the national curriculum. That s the floor we need. But teachers can then innovate in how they teach it. Stories from newspaper archives of troops finding concentration camps or hearing the testimonies of Holocaust survivors who have been immortalised using recordings and virtual reality technology. And now the curriculum and assessment review will take us onward, delivering a core curriculum for all children that is deep and rigorous, knowledge-rich down to its bones. And that matters so much, knowledge is foundational, the building blocks of learning. It s no use developing skills if children lack the knowledge to back it up and that curriculum must be taught by the very best teachers. As a profession as well as a calling, teaching has come on leaps and bounds, far ahead of when I was at school. The use of phonics is just one example where this has delivered for millions of children. Over 100,000 children every year are securing the phonic foundations of reading since 2012. And we will continue down this proud path, for future generations. But now, right now, we need teachers. That s why we are committed to recruiting an additional 6,500 new expert teachers over the course of this parliament, ensuring we have teachers where they are most needed across our colleges and our secondary schools, both mainstream and specialist. Because teachers in our classrooms means attention for our children. And that attention makes it easier to learn, and drives better attainment. teaching, better learning. But alone is not enough. I want to drive up the quality of teaching too. Building on the advances in teaching as a profession, and in teacher training. That s why we are requiring all teachers to work towards qualified teacher status and doubling down on evidence-based training. We ll back our teachers with the very best AI, part of an exciting new wave of technology to modernise our education system. These changes are critical for all of our children. But nowhere are they important than for our children with SEND. It s hard to say about a system that today is failing so many, that there has been progress. The recognition of additional needs, the debate around how we support children with SEND is a sign of progress. But there is much, much to do. We must set high expectations for all, spread pockets of excellence right throughout the system. Focus on need and not diagnosis. With children able to access the right support often in mainstream so that they can learn and thrive. Empower schools to intervene earlier, equipping them not just to support, but to excel for children with a range of different needs. Advances in the use of evidence, in the curriculum, in teaching. We ll take that forward, delivering a new for generations of children. But perhaps the key driver of rising standards across our schools has been strong multi academy trusts. Take an example. Tanfield is a school that sits on the edge of Stanley, just ten miles west of where I grew up. Over the decades, tens of thousands of kids with backgrounds just like mine have walked through those school gates. And for a long time, the school meandered along, performing poorly, requiring improvement that never quite appeared, delivering outcomes never quite what they could be. A reality that year after year, kids were being denied the opportunity to achieve. Until Tanfield joined Eden Learning Trust in May 2020. And with a strong head teacher at the helm. That s when the spark of progress finally arrived. The school is now rated as good on some measures, outstanding on others. Exam performance rising, above the national average. That story fills me with hope, because I know the difference a great school makes to so many children with backgrounds like mine, to severing the tie between background and destiny. Academy schools were a part of a great age of reform, from the mid-90s to 2015, a wave of changes that lifted standards for schools and life chances for children. Driven forward by a succession of great education reformers from David Blunkett to Michael Gove, and a generation of dedicated and determined teachers. I recognise the focus on tackling low standards in inadequate schools, which previous governments of all parties shared. I celebrate the enormous effort by parents and school staff, to haul our entire system into a much better place. Strong academy trusts, top teachers, a core curriculum these are our foundations. But sometimes I get the sense that people want to stop there. As if we can celebrate progress, but stop pushing for better. As if the drive for change, the impatience with failure that these are the proud tales of yesterday, not the agenda for tomorrow. Because I tell you, this government is very clear. The journey isn t over, the mission is never complete. It s almost fifty years since James Callaghan gave a major speech about the purpose of our education system in our country. Elements of his challenge, to the established wisdom of his day, are sadly all too familiar. He spoke of a system that too often left young people neither ready for work, nor ready for life, the need for young women to study science, the immense importance of numeracy for the next generation. And he spoke of his sympathy with the principle of a national curriculum, a principle that would fall to the next government to deliver. But today it is not simply the wisdom of that speech I have in mind. Callaghan knew the greatest truth about the determination that governments political content removed should have to drive change, for it was he who told us: You never reach the promised land. You can march towards it. So I tell you again, for me, for this government, we know that this march never ends. And yet today, the barriers to opportunity have grown only higher, and the stakes for our children are just as high. Stuck schools. Too many schools coasting. Delivering an education that, is just not the standard all children deserve. There are than 600 schools in this country that are stuck, receiving consecutive poor Ofsted judgements. than 300,000 children go to these schools. And what happens to these children? They leave primary school with results 14 percentage points worse. They leave secondary school with results one grade per subject worse. Their life chances, limited by the bad luck of going to a poor school. That is our inheritance. And that is not good enough. Stuck schools are the new front in the fight against low expectations. I will not accept a system that is content for some to sink, even while others soar. These schools must improve, and with the right help, I know they can. Our proposals provide a response that is tailored, bespoke, effective drawing on the insights of new Ofsted report cards. Improvement driven by new RISE teams, groups of leading experts who have been there and done it, with a track record of driving up standards. Turning around not just schools, but children s lives. The best of the best when it comes to school improvement. They will work with schools to get to grips quickly with the problems Ofsted spots, backed with an initial 20m of funding. Up to 100,000 per school, dwarfing the basic 6,000 per school that was made available for these very schools by the last government, before being cancelled altogether with structural intervention as a necessary backstop if change does not come quickly enough. We now have our first 20 expert advisers in place and teams are beginning their work with schools up and down the country. Trust leaders right at the centre. To work with us as partners in the push for better. Excellence for every child. High and rising standards for every child. Success for every child. No stuck schools drifting along. Tackling drift by reforming accountability and intervention. Now is the time for reform, for renewal, for modernisation. To take the whole school system forward. The way we hold schools accountable underpins it all. How we identify poor performance and drive change, To lift the life chances of children. We have a strong starting place. The improvements in inspection and accountability starting in the 90s have been instrumental for raising standards in our schools. With Ofsted s role right at its heart. And to those who call for the abolition of a strong, independent, effective inspectorate, I have said before and I will say again: never. Never will we go back to those dark days of weak accountability. Because it was children from disadvantaged backgrounds who suffered the most. And because despite those improvements, there is still so far to go. So today I am taking us into a new era on school standards. Single headline grades were the right innovation at the right time. They brought proper scrutiny to all schools. But the time for change has come. They had become high stakes for schools but low for parents. And for the challenges we now face, too blunt, too rough, too vague. How can it be right that so many critical decisions parents choices that shape whole lives rest on a single word? It simply isn t enough. Not for schools, not for families, and not for children. Our searchlight on poor performance must now become brighter to see the problems of today and tomorrow quickly and clearly. So a rigorous system, raising the bar on expectations, on what good really looks like when it comes to the futures of our children. Because when we hear that 90 of schools are rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, it s a reflection of millions of hours of hard work from teachers and leaders. But it s a statistic, I m afraid, that just no longer paints the full picture. Good as a judgement has become too vague to serve its purpose, When there are schools rated as good in both the top and bottom 1 for attainment. So just like we guard against grade inflation, to make sure that results really reflect the achievement of students, we must protect standards here too, because when almost 8 in 10 schools are graded as good, it s time we bank that progress and take good to another level. The imprecision has left too many struggling schools without the support they need to improve. If the diagnosis isn t clear, how can we be confident that the treatment will be right? And the change this government brings is one the public know is needed. Only 13 of those asked by Ofsted think that the notion that 90 of our schools are Good or Outstanding is truly reflective of the overall quality of schools. We need a diagnostic approach an approach that is restless and rigorous. Our proposals will swap single headline grades for the rich, granular insight of school report cards. Raising the bar on what we expect from schools. Shining a light on the areas that matter, each given their own grade. Identifying excellence and rooting out performance that falls short of expectations, so that parents have clearer, better about their local schools. And that extra will underpin changes in how we tackle poor performance. The worst performing schools, whether local authority maintained or academies will be moved to a strong trust. That means new leadership brought in to boost the life chances of pupils. Children only get one chance: we won t wait around while schools fail around them. And if school report cards identify even one area for improvement for a school, Ofsted will monitor progress, looking out for warning signals, government primed to step in for children, if required. The schools and trusts too, able to take swifter action from the granular school report. Because being hands off, for school after school, for year after year, simply cannot be an option when the life chances of our children are at stake. And because we know that there is so much brilliance within our schools, so much to learn from and share. A new proposed top grade of Exemplary , for best-in-class practice in a specific area, when Ofsted judge that a school is doing something that is simply too good to be kept inside the school gates. Because this is a government that is never content, never complacent, never satisfied, when it comes to standards in schools. We want to spread that excellence To promote innovation, And it s important we recognise that the best people to do that, the people who so often, will be doing that, are already standing in front of us. The best trusts, the best schools, the best leaders. Our RISE teams in time providing a universal service, will draw on them, their practice, their knowledge, their experience, helping good schools to become great and the great schools to become even better spreading their excellence as they go. This is a new era in accountability for schools, a new era of relentless improvement. To drive up standards and open up opportunity for all. But a new spirit too including with schools. A relationship to improve, not punish, to challenge, not to scold, based on shared aims, not shared hostility. An approach that recognises, that when all s said and done, we all want the same thing. Better outcomes for children. When I first started in this job, I said I wanted to put education at the forefront of national life. So I am delighted to see the debate raging over our reforms particularly since we introduced our children s wellbeing and schools bill. I have to say, I welcome it. It is a sign that under this government, once again, education is coming back to the centre of national debate. I welcome spirited engagement, I welcome robust challenge, I welcome different views and I will listen to them. That is how we shape the very best education system that our children deserve. And that s why the changes we are making to accountability will draw on the wisdom of the entire sector. So I am pleased to announce apublic consultation on our proposals for school accountability reform. Alongside that, Ofsted are consulting on their proposals for report cards and inspection structures. I want we want to hear the views of teachers and parents, schools and trusts all those who care about our children s futures. All parents worry about their children and that s because they want so much for them. There were times when I was small when my mum worried about me. People would tell her that I had speech issues, because I talked so little. Well, I m talking now. And to the young people, the families, who feel like they don t have a voice, don t have a future. I say this, Under this government, no longer will where you re from decide what you go on to do. Opportunity, for every child, in every school, in every part of the country. Everything I do as secretary of state, I do for all children. The ones who grow up on streets like mine, who don t not yet have a great school to go to, who are weighed down by their background. I am asking of schools, of trusts, of parents, of Ofsted, of myself, and of this government. And I make no apologies for that, We need change, to turn the drift and delay of today, into the restless progress of tomorrow. Because I believe that background shouldn t be destiny. I believe in the power of education to take us to a brighter future. And I believe each and every child in our country deserves nothing less. Thank you.', 'Speaking at the Centre for Social Justice, Bridget Phillipson laid out plans for a new era of school standards delivering on the Plan for Change. Good morning, everyone.

We want to spread that excellence To promote innovation, And it s important we recognise that the best people to do that, the people who so often, will be doing that, are already standing in front of us. The best trusts, the best schools, the best leaders. Our RISE teams in time providing a universal service, will draw on them, their practice, their knowledge, their experience, helping good schools to become great and the great schools to become even better spreading their excellence as they go. This is a new era in accountability for schools, a new era of relentless improvement. To drive up standards and open up opportunity for all. But a new spirit too including with schools. A relationship to improve, not punish, to challenge, not to scold, based on shared aims, not shared hostility. An approach that recognises, that when all s said and done, we all want the same thing. Better outcomes for children. When I first started in this job, I said I wanted to put education at the forefront of national life. So I am delighted to see the debate raging over our reforms particularly since we introduced our Children s Wellbeing and Schools Bill. I have to say, I welcome it. It is a sign that under this government, once again, education is coming back to the centre of national debate. I welcome spirited engagement, I welcome robust challenge, I welcome different views and I will listen to them. That is how we shape the very best education system that our children deserve. And that s why the changes we are making to accountability will draw on the wisdom of the entire sector. So I am pleased to announce a public consultation on our proposals for school accountability reform. Alongside that, Ofsted are consulting on their proposals for report cards and inspection structures. I want - we want - to hear the views of teachers and parents, schools and trusts all those who care about our children s futures. All parents worry about their children and that s because they want so much for them. There were times when I was small when my mum worried about me. People would tell her that I had speech issues, because I talked so little. Well, I m talking now. And to the young people, the families, who feel like they don t have a voice, don t have a future. I say this, Under this government, Political content removed no longer will where you re from decide what you go on to do. Opportunity, for every child, in every school, in every part of the country. Everything I do as Secretary of State, I do for all children. The ones who grow up on streets like mine, who don t - not yet - have a great school to go to, who are weighed down by their background. I am asking of schools, of trusts, of parents, of Ofsted, of myself, and of this government. And I make no apologies for that, We need change, to turn the drift and delay of today, into the restless progress of tomorrow. Because I believe that background shouldn t be destiny. I believe in the power of education to take us to a brighter future. And I believe each and every child in our country deserves nothing less. Thank you.

First published. Explore the topic Education, training and skills', 'The Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, speech at the Association of School and College Leaders. Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for inviting me to speak. It s good to be here. To talk to ASCL members once again. Continuing a conversation that has stretched over many years, during my time in opposition, and now as Secretary of State for Education, I value your voice and your views. When we agree, of course But even when we don t. I welcome those robust conversations. And Manny, that was certainly robust. And I welcome that challenge because I know you and your members want what I want, what parents want, what this government wants, what the Prime Minister wants, what the people of this country want: Better life chances for all of our children and young people. And through the headwinds and turbulence, the disruption and distraction, this is a government that will face down challenges and focus on outcomes for children. And I know that s what you want too, Pepe. It s been a year of change for both of us since we met at this conference last March. Because, just as this is your first ASCL Conference as General Secretary, it s my first as Secretary of State. I did warn you last year that might happen. And when I spoke here last year, I told you what I d do. I made promises to deliver change for children, and political content removed that s exactly what I ve done. That s where my focus lies, delivering change for them not playing politics or jumping on passing bandwagons or indulging the commentariat. I promised to move quickly on an expert-led Curriculum and Assessment Review and it s already in full swing. I promised a register of children not in school we re already legislating for that. I promised a single unique identifier for our children we re already legislating for that too. I promised a free breakfast club in every primary school we re already starting to roll them out. Promises made, promises kept. With funding. Tripling investment in breakfast clubs. On average a school switching to our early adopter breakfast club programme would get 21,400 funding than under the last scheme. And much of our vital action is delivered by the Children s Wellbeing and Schools Bill. That bill belongs to children. To keep them safe, to raise standards in their schools, and to save their parents money. And a lot of the change we are delivering, doesn t need legislation: the biggest ever boost to Early Years Pupil Premium, new flexibility for teachers to take planning time remotely, new T-level qualifications. We are getting on and delivering. That s what families expect of a responsible government, not words, action that makes a genuine difference in their lives, right now. And Education is a driving force for change. That s why, despite the toughest financial inheritance in a generation, the Chancellor protected key education priorities at the Budget. 8 billion for early years. A 5.5 pay award for schoolteachers. But I know we ve had to make some incredibly difficult decisions already, and I m afraid to say are coming. I have to be blunt about our inheritance as a government, not just fiscally, but on the fabric of education too. You know this all too well, you see it every day. Children turning up still in nappies, not able to speak, absences stubbornly high, vacancies up, the SEND system creaking after years of neglect. The destruction in the social fabric that wraps around our children cannot be fixed overnight. Political content removed But together we re making progress. Building long-term solutions to generational challenges. Rejecting the shiny appeal of quick fixes. Promoting the life chances of this country s children. And I know that you re all doing the same. Your leadership has never mattered with all of the challenges we face. You ve risen to the occasion before. And Monday will mark the 5-year anniversary of the disruption to schools by Covid. You stepped up then. You did incredible things for our children. and I need you to step up again but this time, government will be right at your side. Despite the challenges, I am hopeful. I believe this country s best days lie ahead of us. There are so many examples of excellence in countless colleges and schools. But together we need to go , so that every child gets the best education. That s at the centre of my vision. To break down barriers to opportunity for every child. And it has to be for every child. It s never enough for a just lucky few bright children from deprived backgrounds to succeed. I went to fantastic schools; I had teachers who believed in me, a family who prized learning. I was given the opportunities to achieve. For me, background wasn t destiny, but for too many of the kids on my street, it was. I saw the bad luck of a tough start weigh down their life chances. And now I want opportunity for every child, and for that we need high and rising standards in every school. I know that s a phrase you ve heard a few times from me before. And I say it because it matters. Because standards drive life chances. And it means four things. And it starts with you. Teachers, leaders. You make such a difference in the lives of children. We re working to get 6,500 teachers across schools and colleges, to keep the great ones we ve already got, and for all teachers to at least be progressing towards qualified teacher status. That s the first step. The next is what you teach. The curriculum. And we need a core curriculum in all schools, one that builds on the past, but is fit for the future, rich in knowledge, broad and deep, cutting-edge, guided by the curriculum and assessment review, chaired by Professor Becky Francis and she ll be here tomorrow to tell you about it. But to benefit, children need to be in the classroom and ready to learn. So high and rising standards means breaking down the barriers to learning too. Tackling our absence crisis, supporting our children with special educational needs. The final piece of the standards puzzle is structures and accountability. How we drive improvement, how we as government and you as leaders work together to deliver better life chances for children. So let s talk about improvement, about accountability. Because I know the proposed changes are challenging. I know they ve sparked debate. But that s right where education should be, at the heart of our national conversation. That s why we are consulting on this, why Ofsted are consulting on their proposals to improve inspection. They are genuine consultations. We need to hear from young people and parents, teachers and leaders. Because you understand our shared responsibility. The leaders in my schools did too. I remember one day I was passed a note during a lesson, And it called me to the Deputy Head s office. Now Mr Hurst could be fierce, believe you me. And getting summoned out of the blue put the fear of God into me. And when I got there, he told me to sit down. He told me he d seen the list of pupils applying to visit Oxford and Cambridge that year and that my name was nowhere to be seen. He told me to get that right by the end of the day. And then he sent me on my way. As teachers and leaders, you play those pivotal moments, when futures tip one way or the other. I only had one childhood, one chance to succeed. Where would I be now without those 2 minutes in Mr Hurst s office? No child gets a second chance at childhood. We owe them that relentless pursuit of better. From stuck to good, good to great, great schools sharing their excellence. And strong and effective accountability will be at the heart of how we drive change for children. And the way we deliver improvement is changing too. Smarter, diagnostic, targeted. A system that challenges but provides support too. So that when we identify problems, schools aren t left out in the cold to solve them alone. Backed by swift action. Action in the 600 schools that are stuck receiving consecutive poor Ofsted judgements. For the 300,000 children who go to those schools. That s who these changes are for. Those children. And the spark of improvement in their schools and in their lives that comes from leadership. I ve seen it in my own constituency, especially during the pandemic. Strong groups of schools where leaders could share evidence, generate ideas, improve life chances by working together. And our new RISE teams share that spirit. Taking what s best in schools and trusts and spreading it, so that all children can benefit. Improvement of schools, by schools, for children with government there to challenge and support you. Where performance in schools isn t good enough, RISE teams will be there with targeted interventions. Intensive, mandatory support, backed by investment, guided by top leaders, from top schools and top trusts. Added to that, our universal RISE service, a new offer of support for continuous improvement in all our schools, spreading best practice. Following four national priorities. One is attainment, with a focus on English and Maths. It s not a nice-to-have. Good for some children but fine for others to miss out. No. All children need that firm foundation of attainment. That s why the Prime Minister s Plan for Change sets attainment as a key milestone. We re investing in reading at key stages 2 and 3, building up phonics to fluency and we ll be publishing our new Writing Framework for schools later this year. We ll drive progress across the board, but especially for kids from tough backgrounds. And that progress must start early in life when the possibilities still stretch out ahead. That s why the Plan for Change also sets the milestone of a record number of children starting school ready to learn. So the next priority for RISE teams is reception year quality. Joining those two priorities are two : attendance and inclusion two urgent barriers to learning our children face. Unlocking learning for all children is so important. And as leaders you know it s your responsibility to set the ethos of your school. To enforce good behaviour and to break down barriers. And phones are a big one. As school leaders you all know that so much of the damage caused by smartphones and social media takes place outside the school gates. The Technology Secretary has commissioned a study led by the University of Cambridge to assess the impact of social media and smartphones, strengthening the evidence base on their impact on children s well-being But you know, we all do, that phones are disruptive, distracting, bad for behaviour. They have no place in our schools. And the government s position is clear: you have our full backing in ridding our classrooms of the disruption of phones. And I know that will be the case in the overwhelming majority of your classrooms. But I expect it to be true in all classrooms. So I have tasked my officials to look at how we can effectively monitor what s happening on the ground Because this is not a government of gimmicks and rhetoric political content removed but a government that will ensure that where words flow, action follows. Because if we don t, it s children who suffer. And it s the same for absence. political content removed That challenge was turbocharged, not just by Covid but by no plan for our children s return. It wreaked havoc with children s life chances. You see it in your schools every day. political content removed And our new analysis shows the cost to future life chances. Take teenagers who attend nearly every day of year 11, they are almost twice as likely to get a Grade 5 or above in their English and Maths GCSEs than similar students who miss just 10 days than them. The evidence is clear: absence scars life chances. Every day out of the classroom will cost a child hundreds of pounds in future wages over their lifetime. No parent wants that for their child. No school wants that for their pupils. No government wants that for their country. One in five children persistently absent from school. 1.6 million missing a day every other week. That s the national picture. But it varies from school to school. Our data shows that there are schools, facing similar challenges, but with significantly different performance on attendance. Some doing really well. But others not making enough progress. Not yet learning from the best. And I won t accept the damage that does to those children. I expect schools to catch up fast. And I know that s what schools want to do, what you re all working so hard to do, The way we turn this around is through collaboration, partnership and, if we re honest, old-fashioned graft. Shared responsibility too parents, schools and government. We re delivering daily attendance data, so we can identify, interrogate and tackle patterns of absence. The green shoots are appearing. Especially in our secondary schools. If we keep this up, we ll achieve one of the biggest annual increases in recent memory. On attendance and the challenge of behaviour continuing to work with you to spread best practice. And the way we drive improvement in schools will focus on attendance too. That s why one of those four national priorities for our brand-new RISE teams is attendance. And we re proposing that new school report cards include a focus on attendance too. We re hosting 9 major conferences to reach every secondary school in the country focusing on leadership. Building networks of schools. Bringing leaders together to lead the solutions. And I want to thank everyone in this room who has helped and I m so glad to hear from so many of you that they are working well for you. We will continue to support and challenge schools on this. But another barrier to learning that we all know is the failure of the system supporting children with special educational needs and disabilities. It s not working how any of us would like. And children aren t getting the support they need. Children and young people with SEND along with disadvantaged children have the most to gain from high and rising standards. And a classroom that caters to all is a strength. Children thinking in different ways is a gift. It s time we recognised that. I ve been told this is too hard, that it can t be done. Of course it s not easy, but it is possible. There are schools and trusts doing it already. I ve talked to parents, and they tell me how important this is too. One father told me about his daughter at Becontree Primary School in Dagenham, which has a SEND unit for children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. His daughter moving into a mainstream school gave him faith that she will be able to achieve as an adult, get a job, be an active citizen. It can be done. King Ecgbert School in Sheffield, part of Mercia Learning Trust. The school has a 30-place integrated resource unit for autism. Pupils spend most of their time in mainstream lessons, supported by specialist learning assistants. Inclusion spreads beyond the classroom. Pupils with SEND get the support they need to play sports, to join art clubs, to feature in school plays. The school focuses not just on support, but on outcomes too. Attainment is above the local and national average. All pupils, including those with SEND achieve exceptionally well. They is proof that the inclusion vs standards compromise is no such thing, they go together. As the schools says, if we get it right for our most vulnerable, then we ll be getting it right for everyone . Their Ofsted report sums it up these impressive outcomes open doors to opportunity for all children leaving the school . And that s what it s all about. Opportunity. We need to spread that excellence. And so I m glad their headteacher, Paul Haigh, is now one of our new RISE advisers. This excellence exists and it must become the norm for all of our children. Action is underway: through our RISE teams, through the Curriculum and Assessment Review, through the 740m of capital investment I announced in December. But this is a complex and difficult challenge. It will take time. We need to get this right. We re working with parents, teachers, experts, those with lived experience. Our Strategic Advisor on SEND, Dame Christine Lenehan is drawing on the wisdom of parents, professionals and leaders. Tom Rees, who is leading my Expert Advisory Group on Inclusion, is working with ImpactED, and will launch a survey on best practice tomorrow. Our conversations leave us in no doubt of the scale of the challenge that we face. But I am hopeful. The change we need already exists. Back in October last year I visited Chantry Academy on the outskirts of Ipswich. I met a young boy there with special educational needs. He told me that he had always felt too special for a normal school, but not special enough for a special school. He worried he just didn t fit in anywhere. Until he joined Chantry Academy. And thanks to Chantry s focus on inclusion, that little boy finally feels that he belongs. And speaking to the head teacher, I could see why. Community is the key creating a community within the school where everyone is welcome and connected to the community around them. Chantry is on an improvement journey. After an inadequate judgement from Ofsted in 2014, they joined Active Learning Trust and changed leadership. There is still to do, but the school is seeing tangible progress. Just two years ago one in three students at Chantry were persistently absent. Now it s fewer than one in five, back below the national average. And the share of pupils getting good grades in English and maths at GCSE has nearly doubled since 2019. I love visiting schools and colleges. Because it reminds me what s truly important. What really matters. It s the children. Their life chances, their hopes, their futures. That s what we re here to do. That s who we re here to serve. That s the responsibility of your jobs and of mine. That hopeful little boy in Ipswich, those quiet little girls growing up on streets like mine. But that s the real privilege too. Why mine is the best job in government, Why yours are the source of so much about what s good in our country. Because despite the big challenges, the early mornings, the late nights, the tough times, what we do matters. And I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for all you do. For the difference you make. I know how hard you work, I know it s not easy, the work of turning around children s life chances never will be. But I want you to know that if we come together now, to spread what works, to end what doesn t, to share the spirit of restless improvement. If we do that, together we have the chance to usher in not just a new era of education, but a brighter future too. For our children, for our communities, and for our country.

Former chief inspector Dame Christine Gilbert s lessons learned review said the headteacher s suicide had shone a light on a climate of fear and frustration around school inspection, which had been building for years . This climate had the consequence of weakening trust in Ofsted, which was increasingly seen by many as defensive and unwilling to respond constructively to criticism . It also impacted school leaders and staff wellbeing and thereby contributed to the recruitment and retention crisis evident across the sector . New chief inspector Sir Martyn Oliver commissionedthe review, which made a series of recommendations see below . Acoroner ruledin December that an Ofsted inspection at Caversham Primary School in Reading contributed to Perry s death. The review found Ofsted s initial response to the tragedy appears defensive and complacent rather than reflective and self-critical . Gilbert, chief inspector between 2006 and 2011, found there was no attempt by Ofsted in the early months of 2023 to contact the school or Ruth Perry s family . There seems to have been no understanding in Ofsted at this point that Ruth Perry s death was directly linked to the inspection itself. This lack of understanding is disputed, particularly by Ruth Perry s family. Ofsted s initial approach looks primarily defensive , with a board member describing the inspectorate s approach as appearing to start from the premise that Ofsted had done nothing wrong and just needed to provide the evidence to demonstrate that . Later in the year, Ofsted responded swiftly to the findings of the coroner and education committee. If this kind of self-critical approach, with openness to the need for self-reflection and learning, had been adopted at the beginning of 2023, this might have appeared as less of a handbrake turn . Gilbert said all Ofsted staff needed to see the potential of incidents that have significant consequences for stakeholders or staff. Where appropriate, they need to be able to admit to inevitable human error when it occurs. It is important that inspectors and all staff up to and including HMCI are never placed beyond human fallibility, moving away from the discourse that inspectors are never wrong . Gilbert said Ofsted s Big Listen , which reports today, was the first step on that path of significant change and it reinforces Ofsted s commitment across all remits to serve the interests of users . However, the proof of Ofsted s determination to change will be in its actions. It needs to act in response to a number of very hard messages to effect real and sustainable change, and its progress in doing so needs to be closely monitored. Gilbert said Ofsted s actions should continue with a sense of urgency . The changes should be integrated into a single, overarching improvement and development plan which is owned by HMCI, staff and the board . This top-level plan and regular monitoring reports should be published for transparency on Ofsted s website . The review added that inspectors and support staff should be fully engaged in the design of Ofsted s new approach to professional learning and development . Ofsted said it fully accepted these recommendations. The review found Ofsted s initial response to the tragedy appears defensive and complacent rather than reflective and self-critical . The lack of awareness served to make the coroner s findings all the shocking for Ofsted . It increased the damage to its reputation, not only externally where stakeholders could perceive this defensiveness from media coverage, but also internally where both staff and the board could see the difference between the coroner s judgments and what they had been told. Ofsted should organise a senior leadership development session, involving board members and the executive team, to work through a range of critical and serious incident scenarios . It should include input from experts on crisis communications . National directors, supported by other senior leaders, should play a leading and authoritative role as the guardian of inspection standards and practice in any future critical or serious incident . Ofsted said it fully accepted the recommendations. Gilbert found an obvious mismatch between Ofsted s post-inspection surveys findings and externally-commissioned research carried out for the Big Listen. Independent external reviews and evaluations should be built into Ofsted s plans for reform. Post-inspection surveys should also be administered through a third-party independent organisation. Ofsted accepted the recommendation of independent research to evaluate reforms. But it said it needed longer to consider the budgetary implications of contracting out post-inspection surveys. Ofsted s safeguarding changes have been particularly important , Gilbert said. For instance, a new hub now fields calls from inspectors about safeguarding. But some inspectors talked to this review about their concerns around the impact of additional scrutiny of decision making in this area . Gilbert said Ofsted should ensure that the changed approach to safeguarding does not shift the balance to the point where it causes inspectors to avoid making the right decisions in the interest of keeping children safe . Ofsted said it fully accepted the recommendation. Changes tocomplaint procedureshave been well received but there remains a strong feeling that there is far to do . HMIs also reported incidents of senior leaders at inspected providers using the new complaints process to exert pressure , Gilbert said. Some suggested it would help if there was additional on-site quality assurance from senior inspectors when issues emerge. Ofsted should continue to improve its complaints procedure, with a focus on embedding an element of independent external oversight with the power to re-open inspection judgements . Ofsted said it was setting up a complaints about Ofsted hub to centralise its process. Complaints panels, which have been piloted, will become permanent. This review found the learning from Perry s death was determined, and in some ways constrained, by Ofsted s organisational structure and culture . Its regional structure, introduced in 2013, had negative consequences . Regions were deliberately set up to be in competition with each other, particularly in Ofsted s drive to complete the required volume of inspections . Inspectors identified significant differences in style and culture as well as in the operation of terms and conditions . Gilbert said there should be an internal drive for Ofsted to operate as a unified organisation to help ensure a holistic approach to learning and development and should also address inconsistencies in practice. Ofsted said it fully accepted the recommendation. Performance management is patchy, with staff themselves expressing concerns that poor performance was not always dealt with effectively, the report said. The review heard that, at times, there had been a reluctance to address conduct issues when they were raised, with people getting away with being unpleasant . Ofsted should place a greater emphasis on managing and supporting the performance of inspectors so that everyone is clear about what is expected of them, how well they are doing and what support might be needed to do better . Ofsted said it fully accepted the recommendation. Inspectors and some senior leaders raised concerns that efforts to learn from the tragedy and give inspections a human face were undermined by the significant budget cuts the organisation has faced over the last decade and the pressure to complete the volume of required inspections . The review heard the phrase volume trumps quality from inspectors, time and time again. Gilbert said Ofsted should review its key performance indicators and the way it drives priorities . The watchdog accepted that recommendation. Ofsted should also advise the DfE and the new government of the dangers associated with chasing school inspection volume at the expense of inspection quality . The watchdog said it did not accept that we have chased inspection volumes over inspection quality . We regret that we have been forced to de-prioritise vital system improvements in order to prioritise inspections. We agree that we have had to make difficult decisions about what to prioritise. But we have always prioritised to the detriment of much else the quality of inspection. Ofsted s work to roll outmental health trainingin 2024 should now be built on with sophisticated training, regularly refreshed . This should be specifically designed to reflect the unique power dynamic of inspection, with specific models and tools to support inspectors to build appropriate relationships during inspection . Ofsted said it fully accepted the recommendation. This review found the Ofsted board had little or no involvement in determining the strategy for dealing with the crisis and communicating to the media and stakeholders . The board s role appears curiously limited, apparently leaving some of Ofsted s most critical activities outside of its control, unless HMCI chooses to let it have some control . This degree of autonomy and entitlement for HMCI does not make for effective governance. Ofsted should review its governance framework to strengthen the role of the board with the aim of establishing constructive challenge to support Ofsted in its learning and reform . Ofsted said it fully accepted the recommendation. As part of its planning for a school report card, the government should initiate a debate about the essential elements of the wider public accountability system, of which Ofsted is a part . Ofsted said it agreed with the spirit of the recommendation. Samaritansare available 365 days a year. You can reach them on free call number 116 123, email them at or visit find your nearest branch.

Inspectors will award grades on a 5-point scale across a wider range of areas, providing parents with granularity and nuance about a provider s performance and helping to raise standards for children and learners. The very best practice across early years EY , schools, education FE and skills, and initial teacher education ITE will be recognised with a new exceptional grade indicating other providers could learn from it. Independent polling from YouGov showed strong parental support for the new approach to grading. Almost 7 out of 10 of parents surveyed said they prefer the new-look report cards to Ofsted s current inspection reports. Just 15 said they preferred the old system. And nearly 9 out of 10 parents said the report cards are easy to understand. Following feedback from parents and education professionals, the 5 grades have been renamed urgent improvement , needs attention , expected standard , strong standard , and the new highest grade of exceptional . the full consultation response: Improving the way Ofsted inspects education . As part of the suite of reforms to raise standards for children and learners, Ofsted has committed to monitoring inspections of schools andFEand skills providers where provision is not currently at the expected standard in all areas. This will ensure that, where areas for improvement are identified, action is taken quickly to raise standards. In the early years, Ofsted will increase the frequency of inspections from every 6 years to every 4. This increase will be twinned with an enhanced focus on the quality of education and care, ensuring every child is given the best start in life. Since becoming Chief Inspector, Sir Martyn Oliver has expressed his determination to do to highlight the experiences of disadvantaged and vulnerable children. Today, Ofsted has confirmed that every education inspection will focus on provision for disadvantaged children, those with a special educational need or disability SEND , and those who are known to social care through a specific grade for inclusion . The inspectorate has listened carefully to feedback from professionals, making a number of changes and improvements to its proposed approach following consultation. Importantly, Ofsted has acted on concerns about workload and well-being. Alongside the consultation, Ofsted commissioned an independent review of well-being by Sinéad McBrearty, Chief Executive of Education Support,which is also published today. In response, Ofsted has set out measures to address her recommendations, including adding an additional inspector to school inspections. Ofsted s revisions to education inspections will support its core purpose to inspect schools, early years and education providers objectively, in the best interests of children, their parents and carers while taking account of the needs and well-being of education professionals. The inspectorate hopes these measures will be welcomed and has committed to continue engaging with parents and professionals, learning from their feedback and listening to constructive criticism to improve. His Majesty s Chief Inspector, Sir Martyn Oliver said: Ofsted exists to keep children safe and improve their lives. Children deserve the best possible education; their parents deserve the best possible and education professionals deserve to have their work fairly assessed by experts. The changes we are presenting today aim to achieve all 3 of these things. Our new report cards will give parents a clearer understanding of the strengths and areas for improvement at the places where their children learn. We will work with the professionals in schools, early years and education to help them showcase the best of what they do and help them identify where they can improve. details Following last year sBig Listen,Ofsted set out an ambition to reset relationships with the professionals it inspects and regulates, while retaining the confidence of the children, parents and carers it works for. This included a commitment to revise the education inspection framework and introduce new report cards. In February 2025,a 12-week consultation set out a series of proposals for change, covering early years, state-funded schools, non-association independent schools,FEand skills, andITEproviders. Ofsted received than 6,500 responses to the online consultation from parents and education professionals. Feedback was also gathered through focus groups and roundtables; in-depth discussions with experts; test visits to volunteer settings, and independent qualitative and quantitative research. The reforms announced today are based on this rich and varied evidence. Alongside theconsultation response, Ofsted has published the final versions of theeducation inspection toolkits and new operational guideswhich describe how the revised methodology will change the look and feel of inspection. The reforms will come into effect in November 2025. Key changes include: Anew inspection report cardto highlight excellence and identify areas for improvement driving high and rising standards. The report card will provide nuance for parents and providers, combining at-a-glance grades with narrative summaries of strengths and areas for improvement. Following extensive feedback and user testing of February s proposed version, the report card has been redesigned to make it accessible, particularly on mobile devices. Anew 5-point grading scaleto set high expectations, while encouraging improvement where it is needed.

Increased resource and training for inspection teams will drive quality and consistency: an additional school inspector will add capacity to the team, allowing the lead inspector to spend time with leaders including any nominee , as well as overseeing and quality assuring the inspection. As part of the revised approach, inspectors will put emphasis on parental engagement particularly in schools. Jason Elsom, Chief Executive of Parentkind, the UK s largest parent charity, said: Ofsted has shown that it is listening to parents. When Sir Martyn Oliver became Chief Inspector, he promised reform and today we are seeing Ofsted begin to deliver on that promise. We know that strong partnerships between home and school make a huge difference to children s wellbeing and outcomes. Yet, too often, resource-stretched schools have been unable to prioritise parental engagement when other performance measures have taken precedence. The new inspection framework for schools in England changes that. For the first time, parental engagement is given clear priority: no school will be able to achieve top marks unless it demonstrates that it has got this right. This is a significant step forward. Ofsted deserves credit for making space for parents in its new framework, and schools will now be expected to reflect this in their work. Above all, this move will go a long way towards rebuilding trust between schools and parents. Sir Jon Coles, Chief Executive of United Learning, England s largest academy trust, said: It is important to our school system, to parental confidence and ultimately to the success of children that there is high quality, trusted, independent and rigorous reporting to parents about the quality of their local schools. I am pleased that the new inspection framework looks set to provide this. Timeline The reforms will take effect from 10 November 2025 for early years, state-funded schools, andFEand skills inspections. ForITEand non-association independent schools, inspections will commence under the renewed framework from January 2026. There will be no routine inspections of state-maintained schools andFEand skills providers in the first half of the autumn term, as the previous cycle of inspections was completed in July. When inspections of state-funded schools begin in November, Ofsted has agreed with the Secretary of State to prioritise schools that volunteer for inspection. Routine inspections will be introduced on or after 1 December, depending on the number of schools that volunteer. There will be no routine inspections during the week before Christmas, to allow for inspector training. The implementation and impact of the reforms will be tested through a continual programme of evaluation, which will include an externally commissioned review of the operation of the renewed framework.

These include notifying leaders of forthcoming inspections on a Monday, reforming its inspection framework ahead of the rollout of report cards and new safeguarding letters. It comes after ministersyesterday axed single-phrase overall grades for schools with immediate effect. The Big Listen consultation sought the views of school staff, education organisations and parents on schools, safeguarding, SEND, teacher training, social care and education. Some 16,033 people responded to the consultation, including feedback from 10,000 teachers, leaders and other professionals who work in schools. Sir Martyn Oliver, Ofsted s chief inspector, said: You have spoken, we have listened, and now it is time to act. Here is what you need to know A key change will see Ofsted give leaders notice of all routine, graded and ungraded, inspections on a Monday, in new a approach set to be piloted over Autumn term. So, heads will know by Monday afternoon if an inspection is planned for that week. Inspectors will then visit schools on a Tuesday and Wednesday and write reports on Thursdays. On Fridays, Ofsted bosses will lead a rigorous consistency review of inspection finding and activities such as lead inspector training will also take place. Ofsted has pledged to consult later this academic year on creating a reformed education inspection framework EIF for schools, early years and FE and skills. This will heed lessons from the Big Listen and be necessary to accommodate the government s pledge to rollout report cards from September 2025. Ofsted said it wanted to introduce rubrics that offer clear criteria for inspections and can support leaders to self-evaluate their practice as part of the EIF reform. The inspectorate also wants to make inspection collaborative and supportive, a key issue flagged through the consultation, by using these rubrics to guide chats between inspectors and leaders about a school s strengths and areas for improvement. Ofsted said it will make it clearer what schools should improve, but not tell them how to improve, in a nod to leaders independence and expertise . It will also make sure the inspection process is appropriate to the school phase and type, take contexts into account, Ofsted said. Ofsted will do a workload impact assessment for any reform it makes to the framework. However, Oliver wants to avoid change for change s sake and intends for excellent aspects of the EIF, such as focus on the curriculum and early reading, to be kept. Oliver said Ofsted will start informally consulting on report cards from today, working on this through autumn to develop a model. He hopes to formally consult between January and Easter and for Ofsted to do piloting and training of its workforce after Easter. The new report cards will include area insights . The service will visualise local area data across all areas Ofsted inspects and regulates, to give parents and to help inspectors understand local context. Ofsted wants the service to set out what it is like to be a child in any area, from childminder provision and both school phases, all the way up to a post-16 provider or a training provider. This will transform the way parents and carers can find out about schools, including the experiences that all children have in their local area, particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged children, Ofsted said. It hopes the service will identify places that need extra help from the government to support vulnerable children. Ofsted will consult on introducing a criterion , understood to be Ofsted s new word for sub judgments, for inclusionwithin the report card. This will evaluate whether schools are providing high-quality support for disadvantaged and vulnerable children . And Oliver said Ofsted want to look at an evidenced based review of the pupil premium as part of this work. The tricky issue of how inclusivity will be measured will be consulted on. But Oliver said he is starting from the position of local schools for local children , with settings risking being graded down if they turn SEND children away. He also toldSchools Weekhe believed attendance was worthy of highlighting on it s own , suggesting that may become a criterion too. Ofsted and the CQC health and social care watchdog will review area SEND inspections to enable local areas to enhance the support they offer , pausing monitoring inspections until this is done. The new framework was launched in January 2023. From this month, Ofsted will pilot a new approach to safeguarding reporting in graded inspections. If a school is good or better in all other areas but fails in safeguarding, and inspectors think the leadership has the capacity to fix this, they can call the inspection incomplete and return within three months to complete it, withholding judgment in the meantime. This won t involve reopening and rejudging the areas that we have found to be good or outstanding elsewhere, Oliver said. But Ofsted will only allow this if school leaders agree to send a letter, which Ofsted will produce, to parents, explaining the situation. The report cards will also include a separate safeguarding criterion , distinct from leadership and management. And Ofsted will make it clearer what inspectors are looking for when they review a school s central record. Aspreviously revealed bySchools Week, the inspectorate plans to launch a service called Ofsted Academy this Autumn. It said this would collate all its induction, training, learning, development and good practice work in a single place and transform how it recruits and trains staff. The resource will also include face-to-face training and development and will develop an insights library to share exemplary practice in the sectors it inspects and regulates. As part of the Academy, we will introduce secondments for inspectors to spend time working in providers. This will make sure their practice remains current, especially focusing on working across groups of providers, Ofsted said. Ofsted said its current regional model had created inconsistency in how it carries out some of its work. So, it is setting up six national hubs, led by regional directors, each specialising in a specific area of its work. For instance, one hub will centralise all complaints about Ofsted, which will be investigated independently of their region of origin. Other hubs will focus on areas such as inspection welfare, support and guidance and quality assurance and professional standards and provider intelligence and area insights . Ofsted said it had also set up seven external reference groups, across areas such as curriculum, teaching and assessment, behaviour and attendance and inclusion. These will provide independent advice and challenge and share ideas and feedback, including on its frameworks. In a bid to increase transparency, Ofsted said it will do user research to look at recording and transcribing the final feedback meetings and sharing these with leaders. Ofsted has also signalled a willingness to better share the evidence that underpins our reports directly with leaders , to help heads understand how it reaches its conclusions. In response to allegations that its complaints process often felt like it was marking its own homework, Ofsted has piloted complaints panels for the schools and early years sectors. These include external sector representatives who review whether it has handled a sample of complaints fairly and in line with its policy. Ofsted said it will make this a permanent feature of its complaints processes across all areas. Ofsted said it will work with ministers on upcoming legislation to allow it to inspect multi-academy trusts, but has not put a timescale on the reform. The inspectorate also strongly believes the reform should be expanded to cover all school groups It said this would help to improve standards across the system and make sure accountability reflects decision-making, separating schools from the trusts in which they sit . Oliver believes trust-level inspections will be a medium to longer term project. He said he thinks there is a way of providing both an individual report to a school and looking at the group responsible . The inspectorate said its most challenging Big Listen feedback was about its culture. A NatCen survey, commissioned by Ofsted, of 4,349 parents and carers, found a quarter disagreed that the inspectorate could be trusted. Just 49 per cent said it could be. Schools were much less likely to say Ofsted achieved its ambition of being trusted compared to other providers, according to findings by IFF Research. Just 29 per cent of schools agreed with the statement compared to 47 per cent for teacher development providers, and up to 72 per cent for social care.']",Ofsted inspections and accountability
1,349,1_students_results_year_pupils,"['students', 'results', 'year', 'pupils', 'grades', 'ofqual', 'grade', 'gcse', 'cent', 'maths']","[""Results for A-Levels, T-Levels and other Level 3 qualifications are out today. And, as always, we ve analysed the national figures published by theJoint Council for QualificationsandOfqualto bring you a round-up of everything you need to know. For the last few years, the big headlines about A-Level results have been focused on grading. But this year, for the first time since 2020, there haven t been any dramatic changes to the way that A-Levels have been graded. Pre-pandemic, grades tended to be consistent across years. But in 2020 and 2021, following the cancellation of public exams, grades rose sharply. In 2021, 44.3 of GCSEs were graded A or above, compared to 25.2 in 2019. In 2022, grades were set to a mid-point between 2021 and 2019, to avoid a sharp fall. And last year, they returned to close to 2019 levels. In theory, awarding bodies were able to award higher grades this year if they believed a higher quality of work had been produced by this year s candidates 1 . This may well have happened a bit as results are slightly up this year. Last year, 26.5 of entries received a grade A or A, compared to 27.6 this year, an increase of 1.1 percentage points. And in 2019, 25.2 received an A or A, so this increase this year compared to pre-pandemic is 2.5 percentage points. We should also note that, while last year's grades in England were back to pre-pandemic levels, that wasn't the case in Wales and Northern Ireland. As A-levels in Northern Ireland and Wales are not regulated by Ofqual, we wouldn't necessarily expect their approach to getting back to pre-pandemic grades to be the same as England's, so this was not entirely unexpected. There are also some differences in how A-Levels are structed in Wales and Northern Ireland: AS-levels remain a constituent part of A-levels in Northern Ireland and Wales too, so last year's results contained results from exams taken the previous year, when grades were generally higher. All that noted, this year grades in Wales and Northern Ireland have returned to levels very similar to pre-pandemic. Which means that there has been quite a sharp fall in grades compared to last year. In Wales, the proportion of entries grade a or above has fallen from 34.0 to 29.9 , and in Northern Ireland the proportion has fallen from 37.5 to 30.3 . As we ve seen, England completed its return journey to 2019 grading standards last year. While grades are similar overall, that doesn t necessarily mean they ve been consistent at the subject level. Grades might have increased in a subject if this year s entrants had a higher level of prior GCSE attainment relative to other subjects. With that in mind, it is unsurprising that there was little difference in A -A grades awarded compared to 2023 in each subject, with a few exceptions. Leaving the other modern languages , a portmanteau category for languages other than French, German and Spanish, to one side, there was an increase of at least 2 percentage points in A -A grades awarded in computer science, design and technology and German. Compared to 2019, the percentage of pupils achieving A -A was at least 5 percentage points higher in computer science, maths, German, performing expressive arts and other modern languages . A -A grades were lower compared to 2019 in just two subjects, sociology and classical subjects 2 .

We thought we d see increases in maths, maths, computing and physics, and decreases in drama, geography and sociology. And indeed, we have. But what do these one year changes look like in context? Below, we compare the actual number of entries over the past six years with a hypothetical number, which is based on the trend in entries for all subjects since 2019. First, the subjects with the biggest falls since last year: Entries in drama have been trending down steadily since 2019, with an acceleration in 2023 and 2024. For geography and particularly sociology, this year s drop bucks a trend of increasing entries over the past few years. But geography has had a drop in entries before, back in 2020, and recovered; the same could happen again. And the drop in sociology this year may just turn out to be another blip. And the subjects with the biggest increases: Computer science entries have been trending up steadily since 2019. The increase in physics entries reverses the trend in falling entries since 2021. Results for students completingT-levelshave also been published today. These are still relatively new vocational qualifications with occupational specialisms. 16 have now been rolled out, with plans for 24 in total 3 . 7,380 results were issued to students today, slightly less than were given results in A-level Spanish. But although 16 occupational areas were available, some dominate than others, particularly for female students. Almost 75 of entries in T-levels by female students were in education and early years and health. There was of a spread of entries across the specialisms among male students. The Department for Education publishes a retained and assessed measure,broadly speaking the proportion of students who start a course who go on to complete it. Today sstatistical releaseshows that 29 of T-levels started were not completed. For comparison, DfE also provides the same measure for students who completed large i.e. equivalent to 3 A-levels vocational and technical qualifications. Although data for the 2023 24 has not yet been published, among the previous cohort completion stood at 25 . For students taking 3 A-levels, the equivalent figure was 12 . However, bear in mind that we re not necessarily comparing like with like A-Level entrants tend to have higher GCSE attainment, for example . As T-levels bed-in, other vocational and technical qualifications VTQ remain available. These cover a wide range of qualifications in a wide range of subjects but are usually classified as applied general qualifications of which BTEC is the most widely known and technical certificates. 39,000 results were awarded a qualification with a Distinction Merit Pass grading structure equivalent to 3 A-levels such as the BTEC extended diploma . Another 20,000 results were awarded in qualifications with the same grading structure but equivalent to 2 A-levels such as the BTEC diploma . Both these figures are around 5 down on last year. Note that some double counting of students is possible among those numbers although it is likely to be small. In principle,according to UCAS at least, a distinction is equivalent to grade A at A-level althoughwe had some thoughts about that a few years ago. Compared to 2019, the percentage of students achieving a qualification equivalent to DDD or higher is largely the same. However, the percentage achieving DD or higher is slightly higher 49 compared to 45 . One thing that caught our eye this morning was the increase in maths entries since last year from male students. Did this drive the overall increase in entries to maths? And what about other STEM subjects with big increases in entries? The answer to the first question is yes and no. Entries in maths increased by around 10k around 7k for male students and 3k for female. So, in absolute terms, of the overall increase is down to an increase in entries from male students. But the proportional change was roughly the same for both genders an increase of around 12 for male students and around 10 for female. So, the greater contribution from male students to the overall increase in entries is largely explained by the maths cohort tending to contain a greater proportion of male than female students. What about other STEM subjects? Well, in all three subjects, of the increase in entries is due to increases in entries among male students. But in physics, as in maths, the proportional change was roughly the same for both genders up 12 for male students, up 15 for female . In maths, it was slightly higher for male students up 22 than female up 16 . But in computer science, the proportional increase was much higher for female students up 29 than male up 9 . The gender gap at A-Level doesn t tend to be quite as clear cut as it is in earlier years. Male students tend to be likely to achieve A grades, but female students tend to get higher grades on average. During the pandemic, the gender gap in grading at both Key Stage 4 and Key Stage 5 grew. And at A-Level, the typical gap at A level reversed: during this period, female students were likely to achieve a top grade than male students. The gender gap returned to roughly pre-pandemic levels last year, and remains similar this year. The gap in top grades widened very slightly: last year, 8.8 of entries from male students and 8.5 of entries from female students achieved an A , a gap of 0.3 percentage points. This year, 9.5 of entries from male students and 9.1 of entries from female students achieved an A , a gap of 0.4 percentage points. We will be keeping our eyes peeled for the gender gap in GCSE results next week:reports do suggest that we could see a relative fall in girls attainment. Regional gaps in grading have been around for a long time, and they re not going anywhere this year. The chart below shows the proportion of students achieving a grade A or above this year, in 2019, the last year before the pandemic, and in 2021, when grading was at its highest. The proportion is consistently highest in London and the South East. In both areas, close to a third of entries received top grades, compared to 22.5 in the East Midlands. And in both these regions, particularly London, grades are currently higher than pre-pandemic, while in most of the country they have returned to 2019 levels. But, while these differences should not be ignored, we would sound a note of caution. Differences between regions can maskeven significant differences within regions. Too much focus on region may be a distraction from where the real focus should be: on supporting low attaining students, wherever they are. Ofqual publishes data on attainment by centre type at a national level. Across all subjects and all centre types, the proportion of A-levels awarded grades A -A in 2024 was largely the same as in 2019. Results were slightly lower among students at FE colleges and slightly higher among those in independent schools. Although Ofqual appear to have updated their 2019 figures to take account of centres most recent self-declared types, they have not provided recalculated 2021 figures. We have used those from a previous release with the caveat that the figures may be different if the current type was used. Bear in mind that the centre types are self-declared by centres. The categories used by Ofqual aren t in themselves mutually exclusive a secondary comprehensive can be an academy, for example . Every year we recommend they switch to a appropriate set using data fromGet About Schools. Consequently, it s probably not worth reading too much into this breakdown at this stage. Before we sign off, just one final point. Although it's exciting especially for data bods like ourselves to look at each year's results the day they come out, it takes a bit of time to process the data and work out what it means for the population as a whole. The stats that really matter tend to be found inDfE's detailed publication on Level 2 and 3 attainment by age 19, which are due to be published in April. And these don't usually get anything like the same attention as those that come out on results day.

The fall in the grades is no surprise back in autumn last year, Ofqual confirmedthat grades this year would return to pre-pandemic levels. And, as expected, grades this year are much closer to 2019 levels than last year. But they remain slightly above those in 2019.

This year, 22.7 of GCSEs were graded 9-7, compared to 21.9 in 2019. And 70.5 were graded 9-4, compared to 69.9 in 2019. On the other hand, the proportion graded 9-1 is slightly down: this year, it stands at 98.1 , compared to 98.4 in 2019. For anyone who s not clear on why grades were higher during the pandemic, here s a quick primer. In both 2020 and 2021, public exams were cancelled and grades were awarded using different systems, known as Centre Assessment Grades CAGs and Teacher Assessed Grades TAGs . The grades awarded using CAGs and TAGs were higher, on average, than those awarded in typical years. And last year, to avoid a sudden sharp fall in grades, they were adjusted to a level between their peak in 2021 and the level in 2019, the year before the pandemic affected exams. Ofqual signalled that grades awarded in 2023 would return to 2019 standards and that is exactly what we see in this year s results. Results have fallen in all subjects compared to last year and are now in line with 2019 results. At grades 9-7, 2023 results are mostly within 2 percentage points of 2019 results for the subjects shown the 24 with the most entries by 16 year olds in England . Results in statistics were slightly lower 18.2 in 2023 compared to 20.5 but this may be explained by a change in the entry profile of students. There were 28 entries in 2023 than in 2019. By contrast, there has been a 12 increase in entries in computer science since 2022. This is on top ofincreases in entries at A-levelas well. However, prior to that entries had remained rather flat despite the increase in population size. 24 of entries were awarded grades 9-7 in 2023 compared to 21 in 2019. 9-7 grades in French and German but not Spanish also remained above 2019 levels. This is welcome given therelative difficulty of MFL compared to other subjects. This followswork by Ofqual to adjust the grading standards in French and Germanin 2020. However,we wrote at the time that these adjustments were unlikely to go far enoughbut will examine this year s results later in the year. Now, let s turn to grades 9-4. As at grades 9-7, most differences between figures for 2023 and 2019 are within 2 percentage points. The exception was again statistics with a fall of 4 percentage points. Attainment improved slightly by less than 1 percentage point in French and German but fell by a similar amount in Spanish. 72 of pupils achieved grades 9-4 in maths. Consequently, around 28 of the cohort will have to study maths in the Autumn as part of their post-16 programme of study. The calculation for English is slightly complicated as some of the pupils who did not achieve grade 4 in English language may have achieved grade 9-4 in English literature and therefore not have to study English post-16. Finally a word on fails grade U in English. 1.6 of entries were graded U in 2023 compared to 1.0 in 2019. This is a finding worth digging into later in the year alongside data relating to pupils who were not entered at all. The subjects with the biggest proportional drops in entries since last year are the performing arts subjects: drama, music and performing expressive arts. As the chart below shows, this is part of a longer-term trend, although it should be remembered that there area number of popular vocational and technical qualification in these subjectswhich aren t included here. The subjects with the biggest increases in entries since last year are statistics, business studies and social science subjects. Entries in business studies and social science subjects had been increasing in recent years. Statistics had seen a drop in entries over the pandemic years, perhaps reflecting its traditional status as an extra subject, with the increase this year representing a recovery. The percentage of GCSE entries graded 9-7 in independent schools in 2023 46.6 was lower than in 2019 47.2 . By contrast, attainment in state-schools remained above 2019 levels. At this stage, we don t know whether this might be at least partially explained by changes in entries in international GCSEs, which won t be included in these figures. Wewrote last year about how we thought the percentage of 9-7 grades awarded by independent schools was too highwhen awarded by centre assessment grades in 2020 and teacher assessed grades in 2021. A note of caution with the above chart is that the centre types are self-declared by centres rather than those typically used to report school performance statistics such as those found inGet About Schools. For example, the underlying data shows that there were 86 secondary selective schools- just over half the true number. Thefigures presented by Ofqualare also based on all pupils in England rather than just 16 year olds, which would be a better comparison. Grades in England have largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. However, in Wales and Northern Ireland, they remain higher. The proportion of 16-year-old pupils achieving the top grades is 0.5 percentage points higher in England this year compared with 2019, but in Wales it s 2.2 percentage points higher, and in Northern Ireland it s 3.7 percentage points higher. This is similar to the picturewe saw at A-level. Qualifications in Wales and Northern Ireland are not regulated by Ofqual, so their path back to pre-pandemic standards was always going to be different. There are alsodifferences pdf in the way qualifications are structured and assessed in the three countries which makes comparison between the three countries difficult. This year, 28.4 of GCSEs entered in London were graded 9-7. This compares to just 17.6 in the North East. Last year there was a similar story: 32.6 of London GCSEs were graded 9-7, compared to 22.5 in the North East. And likewise if we look back to pre-pandemic: in 2019, 25.7 of London GCSEs were graded 9-7, compared to 16.4 in the North East. So it s fair to say that GCSEs entered in the capital are likely to receive top grades than those in the rest of the country, and this has been the case for at least the last five years. The North East has tended to be the region in which GCSEs are least likely to receive a top grade, along with Yorkshire and Humber. And the gap has widened slightly since 2019, when the difference between London and the North East stood at 9.3 percentage points. This year, it was 10.8 percentage points. Thehigher rate of attendance in Londonmay be a factor. One thing to bear in mind is thatthese figures are taken from JCQ, who include students of all ages and all types of schools in their statistics. It will be later in the term before we see figures for end of Year 11 pupils in state-funded schools, which may give a better sense of whether inequality has widened since the start of the pandemic. TheNational Reference Test NRT is a fairly new idea, with the first tests taking place in 2017. Its aim is to give a sense of if and by how much standards in English and maths are changing over time. Briefly, a sample of Year 11 pupils take a set of English and maths tests in the spring before their GCSEs. The idea was in pre-pandemic times that if the results showed that performance was higher or lower than usual, Ofqual could ask exam boards to adjust grade boundaries. Results in both English and maths, both at the 9-4 boundary and the 9-7 boundary, have exhibited some variability over time although remember that these figures are based on around 6,500 students with a considerable degree of non-response seethe reportfor detail . But performance in English at the 9-7 boundary was slightly higher than in 2019 but in line with performance at the 9-4 boundary although it should be noted that performance in 2019 was lower than in either year either side. It was also slightly higher than in 2022, the caveat about the size of the sample notwithstanding. By contrast, performance in maths was lower than in 2019 at both the 9-7 and 9-4 boundary. It was also lower than 2022. Perhaps these results are unsurprising given thecontinuing level of disruptionfaced by this cohort of pupils. That said, on the surface at least, it could be argued that the differences compared to pre-pandemic times are relatively modest given the amount of upheaval schools and pupils have had to deal with. Even though the results show a small drop in performance in maths, Ofqual decided to keep grading standards in line with those in 2019 and not lower them . This year, 25.7 of GCSEs entered by female pupils achieved a grade 7 or above, compared to 19.7 of those entered by male pupils. Gender gaps in GCSE grades are a long-term trend, but the gap in those achieving top grades widened during the pandemic. At its peak in 2021, it stood at 9.2 percentage points. This year s gap of 6.0 percentage points is actually lower than the pre-pandemic gap of 6.7 percentage points in 2019. On the other hand, the gender gap in those achieving grade 9-4 narrowed slightly during the pandemic. In 2019, it stood at 8.9 percentage points, but fell to 6.9 percentage points in 2021. This year, the gap at grades 9-4 is at its lowest level since 2019, just 6.8 percentage points, with 73.9 of GCSEs entered by female pupils and 67.1 those entered by male pupils achieving 9-4. Pupils who do not achieve at least a grade 4 in GCSE English and maths arecurrently required to carry on studying them post-16. Those who achieve grade 3 are required to continue to study GCSE. For other pupils, they can study either GCSE or functional skills. And the number of resits has increased considerably this year following last year s drop in grades. The chart below shows the number of entries to GCSE maths and English by those aged 17 or above. These entries will mainly be resits. Entries fell during the pandemic when pupils reached the grade 4 threshold in 2020 and 2021. They are still well below 2019 levels but will likely return to a similar point next year. Grades in English and maths GCSEs entered by those aged 17 and above remain considerably below 2019 levels, as they were last year. This year, 25.9 achieved a grade 9-4 in English, compared to 30.3 in 2019. And in maths, the figures are 16.4 this year compared to 21.2 in 2019. For 16 year olds in the same subjects, grades this year are similar to 2019. This difference is probably because fewer pupils took resits this year than in 2019. If 2019 standards had applied last year when pupils took exams in Year 11 then a larger number would not have achieved 9-4 and therefore had to resit this year. But to be sure we would also need to run the analysis combining entries in Autumn and Summer.

And, as always, we ve crunched the numbers to bring you all the facts and figures that you need to know. Many of theheadlines about this year s A-Level resultsfocused on an increase in top grades compared to last year, and even so when compared to pre-pandemic. And at GCSE, there has also been a very small increase in top grades: they are up from 22.4 of entries last year to 22.6 this year. And both figures are higher than pre-pandemic: in 2019, the proportion of entries graded 7 or above stood at 21.9 . Having said all that, grades this year do remain broadly similar to last year and pre-pandemic: the differences are far smaller than the dramatic changes to grading that happened in 2020 and 2021, following the cancellation of public exams and the gradual return to closer to pre-pandemic levels. In 2021, when grades were at their highest, 30 of GCSEs received a grade 7 or above; this year it was 22.6 . If we look at entries from all students in England, there is a fall in the proportion of entries grades 4 or above in both English language and maths. In English language, the rate is down from 64.2 to 61.6 , and in maths from 61.0 to 59.6 . This might seem alarming at first glance, but the large fall in English language rates is largely driven by an increase in resits of which below . The rates for 16 year olds are much similar to last year: 71.6 vs 71.2 in English language and 72.3 vs 72 in maths. For entries from pupils aged 17 and older, the proportion achieving a grade 4 or above has dropped fairly dramatically in English language: from 25.9 last year to 20.9 this year. Grading in England may be broadly similar to last year, but that s not the case in Wales or Northern Ireland. While in England, grades last year were close to pre-pandemic levels, grades in Wales and Northern Ireland remained higher. We saw asimilar pattern at A-Level last week. This is partly because qualifications are not regulated by Ofqual, as in England, so different policies around the return to pre-pandemic levels were applied. It is also the case that there are differences in GCSE content, grading and modularity between England, Wales and Northern Ireland. How comparable they actually are is unclear to us at least . This year grades are similar, if slightly higher, to 2019 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland albeit higher by less than 0.1 percentage points in NI . Across almost all subjects, there was barely any change in the percentage of pupils awarded grades 9-4 this year. Results for 2024 and 2023 were largely in line with those in 2019. The exceptions were computer science, in whichOfqual had instructed boards to make adjustments to raise grades, and statistics, in which attainment in 2023 and 2024 remained below 2019 levels. Entries in statistics have increased 70 since 2019. The inference we make is that the recent cohorts had lower prior attainment than the 2019 cohort. At grades 9-7 we see a similar pattern with computer science and statistics. We also see an increase in results in French 2 percentage points and German 3.5 percentage points , again after Ofqual instructed boards to make an adjustment. However, the results of this were less apparent at the grade 4 borderline, although there was a 0.6 percentage point increase in both. In terms of 9-7 grades, there was little change in results for each centre type between 2023 and 2024. Taking the data published by Ofqual at face value, secondary selective schools were the highest attaining, followed by independent schools. Both improved by 1 percentage point compared to last year. To some extent you would expect these schools to improve by a greater margin compared to other schools. Last year, for example, pupils at these schools would have been disproportionately located at the upper end of the grade 6 7 boundary and thus likely to benefit from any national uplift in performance. There was a slight 1.5 percentage point increase in attainment among schools classifying themselves as free schools. Whether this is driven by existing free schools improving or new schools receiving results for the first time we will find out in due course. We wouldn t too much into these figures at this stage. The data for colleges will largely consist of 17 year olds, whereas results for schools will largely consist of 16 year olds. In addition, the categories are not mutually exclusive. Many selective grammar schools are academies, for example. It would be better to wait for the DfE statistical release in October for analysis by centre type. At regional level, there were barely any differences in results at grades 9-7 compared to 2023. Across all regions, results across all regions were broadly in line with those in 2019. The exception is London, where attainment in 2024 was slightly higher. London seemed to weather the Covid-19 storm better than other regions, aswe wrote this time last year. That said, and aswe wrote with Simon Burgess, the north south divide in school performance is mostly a distraction. Most of the variation in school performance is very local, between nearby schools. Some subjects, particularly statistics, have seen big percentage increases in entries this year. And entries in just two subjects drama and performing expressive arts are down. The fact that entries have increased almost across the board is largely down to an increase in the population of 16 year olds. But we should bear in mind that a big percentage increase does not necessarily mean a huge increase in numbers. Several of the subjects with a big increase in entries still have a low number of entries overall. Subjects with both a relatively high number of entries and a relatively large increase in entries this year include computer science, business studies and Spanish. Last year, we highlighted the steady decline in entries to GCSEs in performing arts subjects. And we ve seen above that entries are down again in some subjects this year. So let s see what happened in detail: Entries to drama stayed roughly the same as last year, despite the size of the overall GCSE cohort increasing. Entries to performing and expressive arts declined slightly again. But, perhaps surprisingly, entries to music increased. And by a greater percentage than increase in the size of the cohort. It s hard to say whether this signals a reversal in thelong-term decline in entriesto music at Key Stage 4, as there are a number of popular vocational and technical qualifications in performing arts subjects which aren t included here. These tend to bequite common in music. But we note in the section on tech awards below that there has been a drop in entries in arts, publishing and media, which includes music among many other. It may be the case that some schools have switched back to GCSE rather than offer the reformed tech award. We will look into this later in the year. We ve seen that the overall sizes of the re-sit English and maths cohorts have increased since last year. This is as expected: the percentage of 16-year-olds who received a grade 4 or better last year was lower than the year before due to pandemic grading arrangements. With this cohort expansion, we might also have expected to see a higher proportion of grades awarded a 4 or better. That s because pupils who were awarded below a grade 4 at age 16 during the pandemic years, when grading was generous, would have been lower attaining on average if judged by the same standards as those who achieved below a grade 4 at age 16 last year, when pre-pandemic grading norms returned. In maths, we have seen a slight increase: 16.4 of students aged 17 achieved a grade 4 last year vs 17.4 this year. But in English, there s been a sizeable drop: from 25.9 last year to 20.9 this year. To dig into this, we can look at results by age. Here, we compare this year with last year, and with pre-pandemic: The increase in maths attainment is largely driven by those aged 17. In English, results actually fell among 17-year-olds, although the drop was bigger for those aged 18 or older. One question this chart poses is why results for 17-year-olds in both subjects though particularly in English aren t similar to 2019. At face value this would suggest that that the quality of work produced by 17-year-olds relative to 16-year-olds has fallen. Is this really the case? The National Reference Test NRT has not been around for that long: it was first introduced in 2017. It is supposed to provide independent evidence about whether standards in English and maths are improving over time to help determine whether GCSE results should improve. This is done by looking at the results from a set of English and maths tests that are given to a sample of Year 11 pupils in the spring before their GCSEs. These results should show if performance among the current cohort is higher or lower than usual, and could potentially be used as evidence to adjust GCSE grade boundaries to reflect any differences. In practice, Ofqual have been cautious about using the test in this way, and this year did not make any adjustments to grade boundaries based on the results, despite a slight drop in attainment in English compared to 2023 albeit with overlapping confidence intervals . It is, perhaps, fair to ask why the test is still being administered if it is not to be used for grade boundaries. But theresultsare still interesting in themselves. We include results for all years since the test was introduced in the table below, but the important comparison is between 2017, the baseline year, and this year highlighted on the table . This comparison reveals a fall in performance in English language, and a small increase in maths. Given the disruption caused to this year s cohort by the pandemic, a fall in performance in both areas would perhaps not be surprising. The increase in maths and fall in English is, perhaps, a little unexpected, given thatprimary school attainment measuresshow a fall in maths and similar levels in reading, compared to pre-pandemic. On average, female students achieve higher grades at GCSE than male students. But there have been some changes to this gender gap in recent years. In the years leading up to the pandemic, the gender gap in top grades decreased slightly: from 7.7 percentage points in 2016 to 6.5 in 2019. And this difference was mainly driven by male students achieving higher grades: the proportion of entries from male students receiving a 7 or above increased from 17.6 in 2016 to 18.6 in 2019, while for female students there was a small fall of 0.2 percentage points over the same period. During the pandemic, the gap increased again to a peak of 9.0 percentage points in 2021. While the grades of both male and female students increased from 2020-22, the grades of female students increased sharply. We might have expected to gender gap to fall back to 2019 levels both last year and this year. But that hasn t quite been the case. It is actually smaller than pre-pandemic: 5.6 percentage points this year compared to 6.5 in 2019. And it s fallen very slightly by 0.2 percentage points since last year. Overall, the proportion of top grades this year is 0.8 percentage points higher than pre-pandemic. But this is not evenly split between male and female students: the proportion of entries graded 9-7 from male students is 0.9 percentage points higher than 2019, while from female students it is just 0.4 percentage points higher. TES have written a thoughtful pieceabout what the reasons behind these changes might be, which is well worth a for anyone who wants to know about the gender gap. This year, results in reformed Tech Awards were issued for the first time. This covers a range of vocational and technical qualifications at level 2 and below studied both by Key Stage 4 pupils and post-16 students. Ofqual use the language of strengthening awards. Briefly, this seems to mean that pupils take their external assessments at the end of the course, and that the external assessments contribute at least 40 of the total marks of the qualification. Many awarding organisations have taken the opportunity to change some of the units within qualifications. Given that we think that thedata published by Ofqualincludes both Key Stage 4 and post-16 students, it s not straightforward at this stage to assess the impact of the changes on the attainment of either group. Overall, there seems to have been a slight drop in entry numbers, particularly in awards relating to leisure, travel and tourism and arts, media and publishing. In addition, attainment seems to have fallen slightly. This is typical when qualifications are revised. Results then improve as teachers become familiar with the new content the sawtooth effect . We illustrate this with a chart showing attainment in awards with this most common grading structure such as BTEC tech awards . In turn, this could have a small effect on schools Attainment 8 scores specifically the open slots of Attainment 8 , which we ll keep an eye on. Just to finish off, it is important to recognise achievements in vocational qualifications alongside GCSEs. But the way they are described e.g. with respect to their grading structure makes analysis very hard to communicate.

The suggestions are some of a series put forward by sector organisations as Labour grapples with how to achieve its manifesto pledge to hire 6,500 new teachers. Research by Public First, including a poll of than 3,000 16 to 24-year-olds, found that although 61 per cent would consider working as a teacher, most crave a good work-life balance 56 per cent and 80 per cent would prefer some degree of hybrid working. Generation Z described in the report as those born between 1995 and 2012 want a career in which they re making a difference , the survey found. But they also want to be able to afford a house or flat, and do not expect to have linear career trajectories within any industry . Just 13 per cent of poll respondents said they would enjoy teaching for their whole careers, while 47 per cent said they would enjoy it for a few years and not their whole career. Focus groups run by Public First also found a strong sense that teaching was a career for later, not now . Academic Christian Bokhove pointed out that England has quite a young teacher workforce already . Government data shows a third of the workforce in England is aged 30 to 39, while almost a fifth are under 30. Only around 20 per cent are over 50, compared to 36 per cent across the OECD group of countries. The report called for a decade-long open door recruitment strategy . That included a 7.5 million pilot of short-term teacher in residence secondments into businesses, which would help bring new experiences and insights into the classroom and provide extensive opportunities for professional development . They could be delivered as whole-week blocks, or as short, half day training segments over an extended period of time either within term time, or the school holidays . 7.5 million would, Teach First said, cover expenses, classroom cover and programme delivery for 450 high-quality, carefully selected placements across priority sectors . Pilots should initially be prioritised for schools serving disadvantaged communities. However, some schools would inevitably struggle to find the staff to cover for those on secondment during term time, putting pressure on teacher numbers. Pepe Di Iasio, general secretary of the ASCL leaders union, said innovative solutions are required. But added organising secondments for teachers to work in other sectors would be exceptionally hard to deliver given the numerous time and funding pressures on schools and it is hard to see how this could be delivered at scale. Teach First said the proposed pilot was based on consultation with partner schools and MATs , some of whome already have such schemes. Some of which involved back-filling, but others used their existing staff to timetable slightly differently for the time of the secondment, the report stated. Macclesfield Academy recently supported a physics teacher to participate in a residency at The European Organisation for Nuclear Research CERN in Switzerland. Its principal Mat Galvin said secondments are incredibly worthwhile for teachers and their pupils and could transform recruitment and retention . But they can also be challenging for some schools, especially those with tight budgets and serving communities experiencing deprivation, as we do . Paul Whiteman, of the NAHT leaders union, warned there are no simple solutions or quick fixes and policymakers must be realistic about what is manageable for schools . David Thomas, a Teach First alumnus and former government adviser who now runs the Axiom Maths charity, pointed out the money worked out at 16,500 per teacher and any pilot should include a control group who are given 16.7k, perhaps spread over a few years . And Loic Menzies, an academic and another Teach First alumnus, said the risk with a scheme like this is that teachers don t return, so you could end up spending money on a retention scheme that inadvertently sucks people out. A better option for those seeking opportunities outside the classroom would be to have a proper secondment scheme for experienced teachers into the DfE, just as countries like Singapore have. A career break scheme would also put forward by Teach First, to facilitate a teacher s personal and professional development for experienced teachers . This would be a period of unpaid special leave, and could be extended on an annual basis as long as the total period is no longer than five years. Participants would be guaranteed their role at the end of the scheme, with coaching support to re-enter the classroom and implement their learning . But Jack Worth, school workforce lead at the National Foundation for Educational Research, said it would need careful thought and piloting . Schools may find it challenging to back-fill their staffing when supply is already so tight. Also, the benefit in terms of retention would need to be clear to make it worthwhile. The report said reframing the narrative around teaching was important , but would require changes to material conditions to meaningfully boost recruitment . Talking about teaching as poorly paid martyrdom will actively dissuade this generation from teaching . Respondents viewed teaching as rewarding 48 per cent , and 73 per cent said teaching was a job with purpose roughly the same as nurses and doctors. But they also described the job as stressful 55 per cent and difficult 45 per cent . Forty-four per cent said they had heard and believed teaching was difficult now than it used to be . The report is the in a series of papers from sector bodies aimed at influencing education secretary Bridget Phillipson s approach to teacher recruitment and retention. Schools Weekrevealed this month that Labour s manifesto promise to recruit 6,500 new expert teachersmay not be delivered for years, and officials are also considering whether to loosen the pledge to include retention too. A report from the National Institute of Teaching this week called for exploration of a range of initiatives, including nine-day fortnights and priority school places for teachers children. There are also potential conversion routes , such as university lecturers moving into schools and primary teachers retrained as pupil numbers in that phase fall. And unsuccessful teacher training applicants should be redirected to other jobs like teaching assistants. The NIOT paper called for a system that embraces squiggly career paths and values experience outside the classroom, and welcomes back those who have dipped out to try something else . Meanwhile, research by the NFER, also released this week, found reimbursing student loan repayments for all teachers in their first 10 years would lead to an increase of around 2,100 teachers in the first year of the programme. But examining different approaches to incentives, they found the cost per additional teacher year gained was lower for bursaries around 9,000 , compared to around 12,500 for student loan reimbursement. This suggests that a policy approach of first raising bursaries where they are low is likely to be most cost effective. And research by UCL s Professor John Jerrim found that young people who live at home while studying for a degree are likely to become a teacher than those who move out of the family home . Teach First s report also made recommendations. These included bursaries reform and widening of the 150 million levelling-up premium retention payments for teachers in certain subjects and areas of England to include languages, geography and STEM subjects and to all trainees regardless of ITT route. Pay for trainees on employment-based training routes should be reinstated to 2010 levels in real-terms, requiring a 9 per cent rise, at a cost of 40 million. Government should also establish a route to increase teacher salaries to be in the top third of the graduate salary market by 2030 to better compete in the graduate recruitment market . Should the government continue to accept 5.5 per cent pay rises each year this would bring starting salaries to 40,000 by 2030. Government should also set out a flexibility entitlement for every teacher . The exact way in which this flexibility is offered would be decided ultimately by schools , but could include compressed hours where a normal working week is condensed into fewer, longer days and remote INSET days. James Zuccolo, director of school workforce at the Education Policy Institute, said by facilitating easier transitions in and out of teaching, the profession can attract the necessary new entrants and benefit from a wider range of skills and perspectives . But the report also emphasizes the need for the DfE to enhance compensation . Teach First CEO Russell Hobby said conditions in teaching had failed to keep pace with what the next generation of workers crave in a career and what they can find in other sectors . This means that, despite having huge respect for teachers, Gen Z are simply not signing up in sufficient numbers. This is holding back the education of our young people, especially from poorer backgrounds.', 'The education secretary says that a rise in teacher trainee applicants and improved retention rates show that her government is turning the tide on the recruitment crisis. Is that the case?Schools Weekinvestigates The Labour government has had little good news for its schools agenda. But new analysis this week has provided a double boost for promises to solve teacher recruitment woes. The number of applicants accepted on to postgraduate initial teacher training PGITT courses for Septemberhas risen by 8 per cent to 18,309 this year, up from 16,950 at the same stage last year. There has been a near 12 per cent rise in secondary teaching, marking an increase in all but two subjects English and classics . Unlike last year, the growth is also mainly from applicants based in England. And increases have been particularly high in STEM subjects with rises of almost 50 per cent in computing and physics. The rise for primary trainee teachers is less, at 2.4 per cent. But Jack Worth, an education economist at theNational Foundation for Educational Research NFER , said forecasts for this September were now looking much positive . He said the rise could be down to retention payments bedding in and acting as a recruitment boost , a cooling labour market and the government s 5.5 pay boost last year. The government this week also revealed it was cutting its recruitment targets for next year by 19 per cent, which amounts to nearly 6,500 fewer secondary teachers. This was because of increased recruitment, rapidly falling pupil numbers and favourable forecasts for teacher retention. Modelling shows 2,500 teachers are expected to stay in the classroom over the next three years compared with previous estimates, the Department for Education said. But targets for subjects such as physics, maths and chemistry all of which have suffered from serious under-recruitment in recent years have been cut. Chemistry has been cut by 40 per cent after favourable retention and returner forecasts. Physics has been cut by 37 per cent. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the school leaders union NAHT, said the cuts were surprising as pupils numbers at secondary schools were set to rise for a few years. It s hard to see why targets would be reduced. We need to understand about how these targets have been calculated. Worth described the changes as hefty , but pointed out that secondary targets had in general been unusually high in the last few years . Overall, it means primary recruitment is expected to beat its target next year, after missing last year s by a record 12 per cent. Meanwhile secondary recruitment is on track to hit about 86 per cent of its target the highest since the 2020-21 Covid recruitment boom. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, described the figures as the green shoots of Labour s plan for change . Following last year s 5.5 per cent pay award, and with hundreds of millions of pounds being invested to help us turn the tide, I m determined to restore teaching as the attractive, prestigious profession it should be, she said. John Howson, the director of DataForEducation, suggested the decade-long teacher supply problem may be finally coming to an end . But key contributors were underfunded pay awards squeezing pupil-teacher-ratios, falling school rolls and a tightening labour market in graduate level jobs . Emma Hollis, the chief executive of the National Association of School-Based Teacher Trainers NASBTT , said people were feeling uncertain about the economic future. The sector does traditionally do well when there is economic uncertainty, because teaching is seen as a safe job in a difficult job market. And while numbers may be improving, others are still concerned about the quality of applicants. Paul Stone, the chief executive of the Discovery Schools Academies Trust, has seen a pronounced rise in applicants to his SCITT. Graduates are coming out of university realising they haven t got a job and there are not many graduate schemes. We can t keep up with the interviews, he added. But he is concerned some of those graduates are treading water and may sign up to get a bursary for the year to train with no intention of really going into teaching . The government estimates that nearly 25 per cent of the trainees who finished courses in the 2022-23 academic year were not teaching in state schools within 16 months. Meanwhile, a third of new teachers leave within five years. The DfE budgeted about 700 million on financial and non-financial recruitment and retention initiatives, not including pay rises. Of this, 390 million to financial incentives such as training bursaries and retention payments. Worth said while bursaries to boost recruitment in key subjects were impactful , few had changed since last year yet applications in those subjects still rose. However, the bursary was halved for English, which Worth said was the main factor behind the 15 per cent drop in accepted applicants in the subject. Despite the positive changes, he warned that schools are not out the woods . A single year of meeting recruitment targets would not be enough to reverse the cumulative damage from many years of under-recruitment. A National Audit Office NAO report on Wednesday found 1,500 vacancies across secondary schools and 2,500 across colleges in 2022-23. Schools also had 1,700 temporarily filled posts. And the NAO estimated 1,600 secondary teachers will be needed between 2023 and 2027, with secondary pupil numbers expected to keep rising. Between 2015-16 and 2023-24, secondary pupil numbers soared 15 per cent up to 3.7 million, while teacher numbers rose by just 3 per cent to 217,500. As a result, the average number of pupils per teacher increased from 15.1 to 16.9. James Noble-Rogers, the executive director of the Universities Council for the Education of Teachers UCET , urged the government to be cautious as the proof in the pudding would be in the final recruitment figures. The figures for 2025-26 will not be published until December. While improved recruitment and retention should be celebrated , Hollis said the government seems to be relying quite heavily on predictions of higher retention . What I don t know is what data is telling them that retention is going to get better? DfE said it will consider sector involvement in its modelling at the next annual review. Labour also faces a new challenge: delivering its promise to recruit 6,500 new teachers in schools and colleges, a pledge first made in 2021 while the party was in opposition. There have been few details after its 10 months in office apart from it being delivered over the full course of parliament, which ends in 2029, and that numbers will be split across secondary and college sectors. The NAO report revealed a draft delivery plan was drawn up in November, but the DfE in February rated its confidence in achieving the pledge as a significant challenge . The extent to which the promise will resolve shortages also depends on how it is split across schools and education, the spending watchdog said. The latter is facing severe shortages as rising pupil numbers hit colleges. The NAO has told the government to publish a full delivery plan for 6,500 new teachers after the multi-year spending review later this spring. This should set out objectives, responsibilities, milestones, and how increases will be measured, and subsequently, publicly report on progress . The DfE said it remain s committed to its election pledge of recruiting 6,500 new teachers, with recruitment to PGITT key . But Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said recruitment and retention problems would not be solved without a major and urgent pay correction, alongside significant improvements in workload . James Zuccollo, the director for school workforce at the Education Policy Institute, also said the NAO report highlighted significant shortcomings in the DfE s current recruitment and retention strategy. The NAO urged the government to extend its evidence base for what worked and analyse costs and benefits of initiatives to help decide where to prioritise resources.', 'Teacher recruitment is on track to improve on last year s dire numbers, but still fall far below target amid sluggish pay growth and increasing workload, research suggests. The National Foundation for Educational Research s NFER annual labour market report concluded the recruitment and retention crisis showed no signs of abating , with teacher supply in a critical state . It predicted secondary recruitment will improve, but still miss its target by about 40 per cent, with 10 out of 17 secondary subjects likely to have shortfalls. Last year, the target was missed by 50 per cent. Primary recruitment is forecast to be about 17 per cent below target, far worse than the 4 per cent seen last year. It comes after the DfE slashed its secondary school teacher recruitment targets by almost a tenth,prompting concerns it was attempting to make next year s recruitment figures look better . The NFER said the 2024 teacher pay award should exceed 3.1 per cent the forecast for the rise in average earnings next year. Teachers should also get a 1.8 per cent hike to compensate for a lack of remote and hybrid working opportunities. Jack Worth, school workforce lead at the NFER and co-author of the report, said: Teacher supply is in a critical state that risks the quality of education that children and young people receive. These trends affirm that ambitious, radical and cost-effective policy options to address teacher recruitment and retention are urgently needed. The research was funded by the Nuffield Foundation and used findings from the Department for Education s working lives of teachers and leaders survey, the labour force survey and the global survey of working arrangements G-SWA . Here s your trustySchools Weekround up of the key findings NFER s recruitment forecast, based on applications made up to February, suggests 10 out of 17 secondary subjects are at risk of under-recruiting in 2024-25. It forecast that overall secondary recruitment is likely to be around 61 per cent of target , with subjects such as biology, English, religious education, geography, MFL, and physics on track for slight improvements in recruitment this year . But theNFERsaid target reductions in several subjects, including geography, design and technology, English and physics, have also contributed to this improved outlook . While we may expect some modest overall improvement in recruitment this year, the forecast shows that most secondary subjects are still at risk of under-recruiting. Primary recruitment is forecast to reach only 83 per cent of target next year in what would be a significant deterioration compared to previous years . This is driven in part by the DfE s primary target having been revised up by 2.4 per cent from 9,180 to 9,400, despite falling primary pupil numbers nationally. NFER said little progress had been made on reducing teacher workload since the pandemic and this is still the main reason teachers leave the profession. It said ministers may face a challenge in meeting their pledge to cut five hours from the working week of school staff, an aim they seek through theworkload reduction taskforce, which will report this month. The Working Lives of Teachers and Leaders survey found the number considering leaving the profession increased by 44 per cent in 2022-23 a warning sign retention could worsen. Teachers reported pupil behaviour was driving higher workload, and behaviour management and pastoral care are key priority areas for workload reduction . The report called for support from outside agencies for specific pupil needs such as SEND support, mental health and safeguarding to help slash teachers workloads. NFER suggested government set up an independent review focused on how to reduce workload to behaviour management and pastoral care. Last year s 6.5 per cent pay rise stalled but has not substantially reversed the deterioration in the competitiveness in teacher pay since the pandemic . NFER noted teachers pay had grown slowly than pay in the rest of the labour market since 2010-11, warning it was imperative this year s award continues to improve the competitiveness of teacher pay relative to other jobs . It said the 2024 pay award should exceed the 3.1 per cent rise in earnings expected in the wider labour market this year, and be fully-funded. Political parties should also set out plans to develop a long-term strategy for pay-setting which reduces the gap in earnings growth with competing occupations , while ensuring schools have funds to pay for these increases without making cuts elsewhere . NFER said remote and hybrid working remained out of reach for most teachers , despite such arrangements becoming common in other professions. Data showed that among similar graduates working in non-education occupations, the option to work from home two or three days per week had the equivalent value as a 6.2 per cent salary increase . Providing compensation to frontline public service workers such as teachers was one option for preventing this inherent inflexibility from undermining the attractiveness of their jobs . A frontline workers pay premium would compensate teachers, they said. We estimate this pay premium for teachers should be 1.8 per cent, which would need to be awarded on top of the pay rise needed to match teachers earnings growth with the wider economy. Recruitment in shortage subjects had improved slightly due to generous bursaries , the report noted. Bursaries in eight out of 17 subjects increased this year and eligible maths, physics, chemistry and computing trainees are able to receive the maximum of 28,000. Comparing this February to last, the cumulative number of placed applications for subjects where the bursary increased this year was 31 per cent higher than last year . In March 2023, ministers introduced international relocation payments, worth 10,000, to attract trainees and qualified languages and physics teachers from abroad to train or work in England. Non-UK physics and languages trainees are also eligible to receive training bursaries, worth up to 28,000 in 2024-2025. NFER said these policy changes helped generate a boom in applications from outside the UK in 2023-24, particularly in physics, where the number of applications was up 253 per cent on the previous year. But thesurgein applications only led to a 41 per cent increase in acceptances, almost certainly because of a higher than average rejection rate and there were just 13 per cent physics enrolments. The changes also applied to MFL applicants, sparking an 87 per cent increase in applicants, but this only translated to a 33 per cent increase in registrations Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders union NAHT, said: It is shocking, but predictable that the retention and recruitment crisis, driven largely by excessive teacher workload is showing little signs of improvement. It s a vicious cycle. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the ASCL union, said: The reality borne out by this bleak report is that, on average, teachers work longer hours for less money than graduates in other jobs. It is very difficult to see how the recruitment and retention crisis can be solved under these circumstances. A DfE spokesperson said the number of teachers had increased since 2010. However,pupil numbers have increased at a higher rate. The department also pointed to the increase in starting salaries to 30,000. To continue to attract the brightest and the best teachers, we offer bursaries and scholarships up to 30,000 for chemistry, computing, mathematics and physics teachers. We are taking steps to support their wellbeing and ease workload pressures which includes plans to support schools to reduce working hours for teachers and leaders by five hours per week.']",Teacher recruitment and workforce supply

Calling on the Department for Education to provide about a potential SEND white paper and timescale for anticipated reforms, chair Helen Hayes called it the most significant challenge facing schools. Schools Weekhas been through the published evidence submissions to pick out some of the sector s solutions Having special schools in trusts was seen as fostering a inclusive environment in mainstream schools , the National Foundation for Educational Research NFER said. This allowed for tailored timetables for pupils and knowledge-sharing and training sessions for staff. The NFER said the government should consider ways to promote and support this blended MAT approach, including by emphasising such arrangements in future funding designed to encourage the creation of new MATs and the expansion of existing ones . Schools Weekanalysis last year found that 212 trusts nearly one in 10 have at least one special school. SEND policy considerations should be built into every policy area rather than being treated as a separate issue , the Association of School and College Leaders ASCL said. To support sustained integration , the government should appoint a minister for inclusion . This would elevate the importance of SEND, disadvantage and other barriers to education and wellbeing within the government structure . If not a minister, then long-term advisory roles are required with status and longevity supporting systemic improvement . The ASCL also believes all heads should be required to complete a SEND national professional qualification NPQ . This recognises that a significant proportion of students will have SEND at some point in their educational journey . This could become a prerequisite to the NPQ for headship and become an expectation for effective leadership . The NAHT leaders union added that the SEND coordinator role has become huge, varied and significant and needs a unified definition that encapsulates core expectations . Meanwhile, mental health charity Anna Freud said established SENDCos should have guaranteed access to ongoing CPD , which is substantial and ring-fenced. This will ensure they understand the implications of new and emerging evidence about inclusion . A SEND state school capacity crisis has led to cash-strapped councils spending on costly private provision. The Local Government Association said profit-making from state-funded education, health and care plan EHCPs placements should be prohibited , with standardised regulations and funding . Private schools should only be used strategically for specialist services, rather than as a default solution , they added. Surrey council said consideration should be given to converting profit-making special schools into maintained settings. There is no justification for profit-making involvement in settings that are solely funded by the state, the council added. However, the Independent Schools Association ISA said private schools were a vital partner in alleviating strain on the state SEND system . They currently teach 132,000 children with SEND. They want the government to let councils place children in such schools based on professional assessments, rather than requiring an EHCP . But Norfolk council said a value for money equation could be introduced for placements, focusing on Ofsted ratings and the cost of schools. The ASCL wants review and reform of accountability measures, including reassessing progress 8 to ensure it does not penalise schools for being inclusive . They highlighted FFT s contextualised progress 8 measure, calling for a wider set of indicators for school performance that include both hard and soft data . Special schools should be redefined to provide outreach and expertise sharing with mainstream schools , the LGA said. This could involve better local partnerships between mainstream and high-quality specialist settings, the ASCL added. This is not just about transplanting what is in the specialist setting to mainstream but building infrastructure to support really effective collaboration to contextualise curriculum and pedagogy to the settings appropriately and our learners. A new middle tier could facilitate school-to-school collaboration , such as regional hubs or networks . The LGA, along with others, has called for a national framework for SEND standards, and a National Institute of Inclusive Education to oversee best practice. They could also act as an independent authority on inclusive education . ASCL wants a rigorous SEND review process . This would involve schools being encouraged to review their inclusion provision using frameworks such as the SEND review process currently being evaluated by the Education Endowment Foundation. Many submissions mentioned issues caused by a lack of capacity. The New Bridge Group, a SEND trust, recommended utilising capacity in mainstream schools with falling rolls . Empty classrooms could be used as satellites bases for specialist school or resource-based units, both improving inclusion . Lots of submissions, unsurprisingly, called for funding. But ASCL s set out a plan for a new funding system, including increasing top-up funding from 10,000 to 13,000 to recognise the rising costs of providing specialist support . A new high needs distribution formula would also address historic inequality across different councils. They and others also called for the government to consider wiping high needs budget deficits to open up reinvestment in frontline services . But the County Councils Network said some councils have already spent significant amounts of their reserves reducing deficits, so there would be significant inequity in this solution . Meanwhile, Nexus trust CEO Warren Carratt said the government should consider regionalising SEND support services, possibly with the metro mayors taking on responsibility, with funding diverted from DSGs to cover costs along with revenue funds . Health and social care are supposed to be partners in the EHCP process, but that is not happening. The ISA said a national SEND partnership framework requiring LAs, NHS services and independent state schools to collaborate could help. They also said all school SEND coordinators should have direct NHS liaisons to facilitate timely assessments and interventions . The NAHT said schools were filling health and social care funding and provision gaps, calling for strong levers to ensure other services can be held to account if they do not fulfil their respective duties . Carratt added that a cross-departmental approach including the departments for local government and health was essential . The LGA said inclusive practice in mainstream schools could be strengthened with a core offer of multidisciplinary support, such as therapists and educational psychologists EP , accessible without an EHCP. Norfolk council said that most EP time was spent servicing EHCP assessment reporting . A national solution would be to maximise EP time with SEND pupils to meet needs earlier and prevent escalation of need unnecessary referrals for EHCP . We believe a model based on EP supervision of specialist teachers and other SEND professionals can achieve this, they added. There were lots of comments to EHCPs, which have soared in recent years, with widespread concerns over their quality. The LGA said a learner record for regular, personalised assessment and planning could stop over-reliance on EHCPs . This would be backed by a legal framework for inclusive education . The NAHT said national consistency was key, welcoming plans for a digital EHCP template. Surrey council said removing EHCP needs assessments for children under five would avoid early and potentially incorrect labelling of children . They also called for clearer guidance on reasonable adjustments including minimum expectations. The Equality Act requires schools to make such adjustments to ensure that disabled pupils are not discriminated against. Carratt, at Nexus, said having a pre-EHCP reasonable adjustment system would be better, and a viable alternative for children with lower-level needs. The threshold for an EHCP would be if a child s SEND complexities are such that their needs cannot be met by a reasonable adjustment . This would be less bureaucratic , reduce the need for multiple professionals involvement and could move a huge number of children off EHCPs, he added. The plan would require amending the Children and Families Act so there is no longer a legal entitlement for all children to be assessed for an EHCP. Councils could act as adjudicator for any disputes. And all suspensions could lead to a plan being put in place. Many councils bemoaned the SEND tribunal. Surrey said strengthening mediation services over EHCP issues between councils and parents, and making them mandatory, would reduce adversarial relationships . The LGA wants tribunals replaced with a new, independent non-judicial resolution such as a SEND ombudsman. Nexus said a accessible adjudication process would reduce legal costs for all involved, but an adjudicator must have the power to direct placements . However, the Independent Provider of Special Education Advice service wants the current local government ombudsman s power extended to investigate complaints from parents over SEND support in schools. Parents often seek EHCP assessments because their child s needs are not being met by their school , they added.', 'The government s key promise to fix the broken SEND system is to make mainstream schools inclusive. But how big a challenge will this be?Samantha Boothinvestigates The government s long-awaitedSEND reformshavepromiseda inclusive education system . But the Department of Education s own research last year found that while some schools have legitimate reasons for saying they can t meet the needs of a pupil with education, health and care plans EHCPs , a minority of schools and trusts used inappropriate and unlawful practices to avoid admitting these children. Schools are subtly dissuading parents by claiming they could not meet their child s needs, the research says. But it happens overtly too, with schools refusing admission. Schools Weekwanted to establish just how inclusive mainstream schools are and the reasons behind any bad practices. We took a three-pronged approach: trying to interrogate the government s claims over non-inclusive practice in the sector, delving into the data and gathering evidence relating to admissions. We emailed 68 mainstream schools posing as a parent of a child with moderate special needs, but not a formal diagnosis. Our email explained we were moving to the area in the next year and wanted to see if the school would be suitable for our child. We said the child had support from a teaching assistant with reading and behaviour management in their current school, adding they sometimes needed things such as time out and time to talk with a teacher, as well as help to catch up in reading. The sample of schools was chosen on a range of factors, including parental concerns, low numbers of EHCP pupils and a random selection. It was made up of 49 academies and 19 local authorities. The only way to get help is to demonstrate your child has failed Twenty-seven schools did not reply. Another 20 wanted a follow-up meeting or phone call and nine said the school was full. Three sent a link to their website which stated their SEND support. Just eight provided full responses, although experts say four could have acted as a deterrent. Schools Weekhas chosen not to name the schools. A north west primary academy said: Unfortunately, we don t have teaching assistants in all our classes, year 4 being one of those without a TA. Therefore, I don t feel we could meet his needs effectively at the moment as we just wouldn t have the staff to support his time out and help manage his behaviour. A grammar in the north west said that without a formal diagnosis or official report we would be unable to offer support on a day-to-day basis without the funding that an official report may provide. They would also not be eligible for any access arrangements for the testing process. Also, as you can imagine a grammar school is a pressured environment and a challenge for any students, as any secondary school can be. An East Midlands secondary academy said: I would advise you that without a formal EHCP he would not receive this support . An academy in the north east said it did not have TAs in lessons unless an EHCP said they were required. If the child had SEN support, they would produce a one- profile on his needs and support strategies for teachers to differentiate classwork for him and make reasonable adjustments to the behaviour system. However it stressed that ultimately the school expectations are the same for all students and if students don t respond to the support offered and continue to not follow school expectations then the behaviour system is applied as appropriate . In a response to a request for comment, the school s trust said it was extremely inclusive with above-average numbers of SEN children on roll. It said that without additional income linked to the EHCP, it was not financially sustainable to routinely have TAs in classes. DfEguidancesays mainstream schools are expected to contribute up to the first 6,000 a year towards the costs of SEN provision. Mainstream schools receive a notional SEN budget calculated by councils. funding can be provided by councils if a child secures an EHCP. The other schools did not respond to a request for comment. Matt Keer, a SEND specialist at Special Needs Jungle, said the responses will come as no surprise to most parents. Most mainstream schools aren t like this, but deterrence is easy, and consequence-light . Margaret Mulholland, a SEND and inclusion specialist at ASCL, said schools often could not offer support because they desperately require additional resources and training ,combined with a lack of space, people and skills. However Ben Newmark, a teacher and parent of a child with SEND, said families were primed for hurt , so a school s wording can be so subtle as to be off-putting . When your child doesn t find learning easy the only way to get them help is to demonstrate they ve failed. It can make you feel awful like the whole world thinks there is something wrong with your child and you re an inconvenience. For inclusion you have to be enthusiastic, you have to go to say you re all right, we re glad you re here . Two responses were positive. One secondary in the north east said it would be confident that most mainstream schools, including ourselves, would be able to provide the support required. Another London primary maintained school said that while it did not have teaching assistants in the year group, support time is allocated to any children in the year group who need support over and above that of their peers . Every child with an EHCP a legal entitlement to additional support should be given a named school to attend. However, that school can challenge the admission on grounds that include that it is unsuitable for the child, or that their attendance would be incompatible with the provision of efficient education for others or efficient use of resources. Despite this, councils can still legally force the school to admit them. We approached councils that had previously complained about schools challenging EHCP decisions. Just Redcar and Cleveland said it had the data. The council recorded 18 challenges from eight schools in 2021-22, up from eight from five schools in 2019-20. Two Outwood Grange Academies Trust schools, Normanby and Bydales, were named. The trust said it did its best to accept EHCP pupils, but in a very small number of cases the specific needs of a child may be such that the school is not best placed to support . They said in most cases the council would agree, but if there were no other options they would always take the child as supporting children with SEND was a guiding principle of the trust . Alistair Crawford, co-chair of the National Network of Specialist Provision, said schools are facing a range of multifaceted challenges such as funding and school building problems. But there are brilliant examples of schools working hard to meet the needs of an increasingly complex and diverse set of learners. We are far less likely to hear schools say that they are unable to meet the need than we were a few years back. This month s SEN data revealed a 9.5 per cent rise in the number of pupils with EHCPs, rising from 355,566 to 389,171. The number of children given SEN support without an EHCP now sits at 13 per cent, than 1.1 million children. Jo Hutchinson, director for SEND at the Education Policy Institute EPI , said trying to understand which schools admit their fair share of pupils with SEND from data was often complex . Deterrence is easy, and consequence-light A 2021 EPI report found a lottery in identification of SEND at school level, something that new national standards seek to rectify. Ministers shelved plans to include contextual in league tables showing inclusivity of mainstream schools after mixed feedback suggested it would risk generating perverse incentives . Hutchinson said while there were NHS assessment services for some types of SEND, others had no common assessment criteria so it was down to a school s decision. Basic data on how many EHCP pupils a school has is also problematic. A low number could mean a school offers effective, early support and a statutory plan isn t needed, or that a need hasn t yet been identified. To try and get a accurate picture,Datalab created an hypothetical catchment of year 7 pupils with EHCPs for each mainstream secondary, to see how it compared to actual intake last year. Analysts found there were almost 400 schools with at least 5 per cent of pupils with EHCPs, but 276 schools had none. A third of the latter were grammar schools. There was little difference between maintained schools or academies, but free schools tended to have slightly representative intakes of their area. However, the study did find differences when looking at individual regions based on their schools Ofsted ratings, as of August 2021. The three areas with the largest gaps between the expected and actual number of EHCP pupils were inadequate schools in London, requires improvement schools in the south east and outstanding north east schools. London s 17 inadequate schools and the south east s 61 RI schools had, on average, nearly four times fewer EHCP pupils on roll compared with their local catchments. The reality? Schools do not have the resources Of those London schools, Gaynes School in Havering had the lowest EHCP rate 0.44 per cent of pupils on roll in 2022 . It did not respond to a request for comment. In the south-east schools, 0.48 per cent of 1,400 pupils had an EHCP at Ark Alexandra Academy in East Sussex. However, the trust s regional director, Lorraine Clarke, said it had robust procedures in place to identify students with additional needs . Sadly, state resources and funding are limited and not all our applications to councils for EHCPs are successful. Nationally, councils rejected one in five requests in 2022. The 24 outstanding schools in the north east had, on average, three times fewer EHCP pupils on roll compared with their local catchment area. The Academy at Shotton Hall, in Durham, had the lowest with 0.26 per cent. The largest trusts those with 10 or secondaries had slightly below average numbers of EHCP pupils. Two of these had way fewer pupils with EHCPs that expected, but Datalab did not name the trusts. One with 11 secondaries had a 2.3 per cent intake of EHCP pupils, compared with a 6.7 per cent estimated catchment. Another had 2.2 per cent compared with a 5.7 per cent expectation. Researchers also said some of the difference could be down to some schools being closer to special schools or other mainstream schools with dedicated SEN units. Hutchinson said the system would benefit from better assessment of SEND needs, which would feed through to consistent and useful data system. This would be a substantial undertaking as it involves a combination of greater capacity in NHS assessment and educational psychologist services and better training for teachers and school staff. Councils must also submit annual reports to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator OSA , flagging any major themes relating to school admissions. In her annual report published in April, the chief school adjudicator, Shan Scott, said it was most concerning that councils kept reporting some schools resist the admission of children with EHCPs. Schools Week sanalysis of council s own reports to the OSA, obtained under the Freedom of Act, found that nearly 50 out of 152 submitted raised issues with admission of SEN children in some way. For usual admission points, such as reception and year 7, Bracknell Forest told the OSA that many schools are not open to receiving children with EHCPs . It added: I have been told by SENCOs that there is a tension between wanting to be inclusive and feeling the pressure of knowing that the school will be judged on attainment. Suffolk said it was not uncommon to receive a response to formal consultations from mainstream schools stating that they would not be a suitable school . Whilst the council challenges where appropriate to do so, in some cases where discussions have taken place between the school and a family, the family has lost confidence in the school s ability to meet their child s needs. Families then go on to request a place in an already stretched special school. Darlington told the OSA it was challenging unlawful responses from schools that declined year 7s with EHCPs. Bath and North East Somerset said recruitment difficulties had led to higher numbers of schools raising objections to the placement . Bromley council in south-east London said some schools cited issues around support at transition between lessons, a lack of breakout space and the length of lessons being 100 minutes with no adaptation. Liverpool said schools could be reluctant to admit a child with an EHCP amid a lack of understanding that the SEND code trumps the admissions code. The council s drive to place EHCP children in mainstream education was exacerbating the issue. Schools often cited resource issues , the council added. Merton in south London said placements of SEN pupils continue to be unevenly distributed amid anecdotal evidence that some schools will use informal means to discourage parents of SEN pupils to apply for them . Meanwhile, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough said many schools always cite the high level of current SEN need a tiring argument and one that is challenged but causes delays . In her report, Scott said councils approaches to admissions of these children diverge with one group content that many schools give a high priority to children with additional social or medical needs, and another group encouraging schools to have no regard to such matters but simply to act inclusively in making admissions . Lambeth in south London said there was resistance and delay in admitting SEN children without an EHCP. A spokesperson said many felt they could not meet the needs of the child , especially in academies and foundation schools. Merton called for a national reminder of the need for inclusive practice in all schools regardless of their admission authority status . They added: The needs of the child, rather than the financial position of the school and their approach to admissions, needs to be the driving force behind the admissions process. The councils who responded to our request did not want to name schools they had complained about. The government s SEND review will push for early intervention in mainstream schools, mostly through the national standards which could be three years away. But there are calls for funding to instigate change. Mulholland added: The SEND Green Paper promised a plan to achieve the right support at the right time and in the right place, but the current daily reality for schools is that they do not have the resources to meet the needs of the pupils they are being asked to support. The DfE was approached for comment.', 'Schools are setting aside cash for potential legal action, being asked to make the case to secure SEND cash and signing up to inclusion charters as cash-strapped councils try to boost inclusion. The government s keyplan to fix the broken SEND system is to make mainstream schools inclusive. Buckling under huge deficits on their high-needs funding, some councils are already attempting to get their mainstream schools to educate pupils with complex needs. But plans in some areas have led to huge backlash from heads, with threats of legal action and fears over cuts by the back door providing a stark warning sign for future reforms. Schools Weekinvestigates Kent council the country s largest plans a raft of changes to get its spending on pupils with additional needs under control. It was criticised by Ofsted previously for failing to tackle a lack of willingness among some schools to accommodate children with SEND. One of the controversial proposals is to change the admission guidance and designated needs that some special schools cater for, to ensure pupils with severe and complex needs can access places. Kent said the current admission guidance means six schools only admit children who are achieving within the range expected for their age, a situation one leader branded as mad . This results in some special schools turning away the most complex pupils and in some cases recommending a mainstream school , council papers stated. In fact, some mainstream schools now have pupils with complex needs than those in special schools . The papers reveal a Kent special school told a parent via an email in March that their child s needs are too high for their school, but their needs could be met at mainstream . Christine McInnes, Kent s director of education, toldSchools Weeka third of special schools now reflect our selective system in secondary schools as they have very, very restrictive admissions criteria . Snowfields Academy, for instance, states pupils must have an education, health and care plan with autism as their primary need. But students should be working at, or close to, age expected attainment levels, within 2-3 years of age expected and on a pathway to achieve GCSE or functional skills qualifications at the end of year 11 . It adds students with a primary need of social, emotional and mental health or a significant global developmental delay or challenging behaviour are not appropriate for the school. McInnes added: Kent is the only authority that I have come across that restricts the entry of children to special schools by saying, we will only take children who can achieve well at GCSE . It s a complete outlier. However, the proposals have caused a huge backlash. Kent Special Educational Needs Trust,which represents special schools in the region, has warned the scale of proposals will require affected schools to make sweeping changes to their curriculum, staffing resources and capital infrastructure . The heads warned there was little confidence the changes will have the desired impact of better outcomes for children or address the deficit. They pushed back on rhetoric from Kent council officers that special schools do not wish to change and are actively resisting change This is simply not the case and is causing friction . Schools Weekunderstands a KSENT leader said during a meeting that it was seeking legal advice on the plans, and suggested it had 100,000 that could be used for this purpose. Schools have to pay for membership. A KSENT spokesperson said the organisation had a contingency fund for unpredicted costs , but said: No monies from the contingency fund are set aside for specific purposes. No money from the KSENT budget is ring-fenced for legal challenge. KSENT headteachers will continue to work with Kent County Council colleagues in order to ensure the best outcomes for children and young people. Simon Beamish, chief executive at Leigh Academies Trust which runs schools in the area, has also said if the plans were implemented, his trust would consider legal action against the council. The proposals would be damaging for the region s special schools, and make it difficult to achieve a place . But Seamus Murphy, chief executive at Turner Schools, said: The system is broken in Kent and there are those who are working with the local authority to deliver change and those who are sticking their fingers in their ears, shouting King Canute-like at the incoming tide and hopping up and down pleased that everybody else s castles are washed away. He added inclusive mainstream schools currently face a triple whammy of lower progress rates, staff burnout and risk adverse Ofsted judgements . Kent said it would aim to encourage academies, which are their own admission authorities, to make the changes. Kent is also creating what it calls a continuum , setting out what needs schools should be able to cater for. A draft document stated secondary schools were supporting children operating within six to seven years below their chronological age. Kent said the contents of the document reflect the range of existing practice in schools. But some academy bosses are worried the new model will mean funding cuts and a lack of clarity about the thresholds for which they will be able to receive additional funds to support children with complex needs. A consultation response is due this autumn. Brighton and Hove City Council is also reviewing its admissions system. They want to rebalance the proportion of pupils on free school meals across schools and have started consultation with schools. Plans include modifying schools catchment areas to ensure they are equitable . Councillor Jacob Taylor, the council s deputy leader, said he would like a system where there is a better social mix within our schools . Several councils have also moved to a locality model on SEND decision making and funding. Generally, an area is split into localities or clusters which are made up of headteachers, SENCos and other representatives. They get allocated a chunk of high-needs funding and make decisions on what support each school receives. Usually, a council just makes decisions on which pupils receive top-up funding from the high-needs block, and the cash follows the individual pupil. Schools can apply for this extra cash, which is for pupils with complex needs. However, Kent council said schools that see themselves as inclusive are less likely to apply for top-up cash because they see pupils instead as part of the ordinary population . This can reward schools financially which are less inclusive, and result in unfair allocation of limited resources, they added. There is a need to ensure that SEN provision is clearly linked to agreed, moderated levels of need and that access to additional funding and support is fair. A similar model has been rolled out in other areas, such as Croydon and Sheffield. In Sheffield, just a small percentage of its high-needs funding is given to the localities. The schools in each locality then agree together how the funding should be used. To access locality top-up funding for individual pupils, schools have to make an application to the panel. A tool called the Sheffield Support Grid is used to describe the different levels of needs and links them to packages of provision to make sure decisions are consistent across the city. In Kent, the proposals have caused big concerns among heads about funding being slashed. Debbie Rousell, chief executive at The Island Learning Trust, added mainstream heads are also concerned about the level of need they will be expected to manage and educate without training, experience or adequate resourcing . She said: All three of my schools are incredibly inclusive now, I m not sure how much complex children we can educate, without detriment to other pupils and staff wellbeing. Another boss, who wished to remain anonymous, said schools are worried they are going to end up out of pocket and having to make support staff redundant . They claimed no financial modelling had been shared. Asked about these concerns, McInnes said there won t be less funding but it s going to be distributed in a different way to enable head teachers to make decisions around what s the best way of investing that money . But they will essentially have to make the case to secure funding. McInnes added heads will have to come and make the case to the other headteachers in their group about why they should get that level of funding which I think is fair and transparent, because they re accountable to their peers . The changes are based on national evidence and research , she added. Some people are going to be a bit anxious about it, absolutely it s a change, but there is widespread support for moving to another system. We can t stay on the same system. But David Bartram, a former government SEND adviser, said that in theory the model prevents a clashing of horns between councils and schools as it still depends on having enough money and resource available locally. As part of inclusion plans, two councils have actually cut their top-up funding. Norfolk headteachers warned of redundancies after the cash-strapped council cut top-up funding to remain within its 35 million budget. Heads warned this will impact on their ability to be inclusive, but the council is already falling behind its spending targets linked to the 70 million bailouts it is due to get under the government s controversial safety valve scheme. Meanwhile, Buckinghamshire Council will only give top-up funding to pupils with an education, health and care plan EHCP , unless in exceptional circumstances . It has a 6 million overspend on its SEND funding. As councils try to lower soaring rates of EHCPs, Margaret Mulholland, SEND specialist at ASCL leaders union, said: It s not helpful to set a precedent that EHCPs are the only route to additional funding. Not all pupils with high needs require a plan, and this could delay them from being able to access timely support. Another focus for councils is opening specialist provision within mainstream schools. A quarter of new specialist places planned by councils as part of the 2.6 billion capital grant they got from government are in mainstream schools, Special Needs Jungle analysis found. There are two routes to do this. SEN units are a special provision within mainstream schools where pupils are taught in separate classes for at least half of their time. These have risen from 352 in 2020-21 to 392 last year, government data shows. The second is resourced provision, where places are reserved in mainstream schools for pupils with SEN, who are taught for at least half of their time within mainstream classes but require a base and specialist support. There were 1,168 of these last year, up from 1,066 three years ago. Norfolk will utilise 120 million capital funding to open 50 specialist resource bases in its mainstream schools, providing 746 places by 2027. This would help reduce its reliance on the independent specialist school sector. Norfolk s special schools are so full that some dining areas are too small to serve all students at once, forcing some to have meals in classroom settings , council documents state. There has also been the elimination of dedicated spaces needed for delivering aspects of the curriculum like art, music or science facilities to make room for classes of pupils . There have also been delays by DfE in the timeline to deliver two new special schools. Extreme pressures in these schools risk lower Ofsted grades, they said. To enable special schools to remain sustainable and to provide good education for their pupils it is imperative that inclusion in mainstream schools is increased, the council warned. SEND consultant Natalie Packer said resourced provision provides balance for pupils, but she is concerned schools with the most physical space will be chosen over those that can provide the best quality provision. She also pointed out there was little guidance over the use of such provision, with leaders widely concerned about oversight. Unity Schools Partnership has offered to create specialist places in its mainstream schools after rolling this out in neighbouring Suffolk. Tim Coulson, chief executive, said they can be quick to open and relieve the pressure on councils, with pupils staying local rather than being sent to specialist provision miles away. Typically, you appoint staff with a greater level of expertise so it s really useful for the whole school. It feels like a special school environment but in a mainstream school, he added. North Somerset is also opening resource bases as well as nurture groups for youngsters with social, emotional and mental health needs. The council, also on the safety valve scheme, warned it faces effective bankruptcy unless it receives government cash for SEND. It is also launching a memorandum of co-operation, which schools are asked to sign up to, setting out expectations on inclusion. For example, schools should ensure that they are using any funding given in the most efficient and effective way .']",Special educational needs and SEND provision

But the government admits it knows little about them. So what do they do? And how much do they cost?Jack Dysonreports The spotlight has long shone on academy trust chief executives, but many now lead growing numbers of centrally employed and sometimes well-paid senior leaders. But what do we know about suchcentral teams? The Education Skills and Funding Agency ESFA admitted in April it has a data gap and is reviewing whether to collect on them. Scoping research is ongoing. Government guidance states strong trusts ensure all staff are focused on improvement. Their structure allows administrative functions, policies and financial management to be delivered centrally, allowing school leaders to prioritise education . A 2021 report by the National Governance Association NGA noted that centralteamsare emerging as powerful drivers for realising many of the benefits of trust-wide collaboration . Many are providing services, such as HR, in-house, allowing them to recruit people with specialist expertise. Sir David Carter, the former national schools commissioner, says another key role is improving education standards quickly by ensuring successful practice is transmitted from one classroom to another across schools. A third, and less talked about, benefit is delivering economies of scale on saving time by stopping duplication of tasks, he adds. But while most larger trusts have established central teams, smaller chains and those looking to become MATs are grappling with how best to do this. Mark Greatrex, who leads the 10-school Bellevue Place Education Trust and has advised others on their structures, says they tend to be formed just before trusts take on their second school. At this point, chief executives start thinking about what they need to do to have that structure and the promises it s sold to secondaries or primaries set to join the group. The academies accounts direction states MATs must describe the types of central services provided to schools during the year . But they aren t obliged to include how many people are centrally employed. Of the 30 biggest trusts, 15 either didn t list the on their website or provide their central team numbers toSchools Week. Unity Schools Partnership provides the names of every central team worker, including cleaners, junior technicians and HR admin assistants. But the Harris Federation simply mentions online that its central team includes around 60 highly skilled teachers available to our academies as a resource to use as they need . Its website does not appear to list any of those leaders other than Sir Dan Moynihan, its chief executive. Tom Richmond, the founder of the EDSK think tank, says it is vital we have transparency over such roles as it is simply not possible to understand the drivers of effective practice if we have no collective sense of how to invest wisely to improve schools . One of the issues may be that interpretations of what constitutes a central team varies. Paul Tarn, the chief executive of Delta Academies Trust, says: I have 42 specialist subject directors. Are they part of the central team? I don t know. It s really difficult to work out , and where I draw my line and say this is my central team , someone else may say that s not. Two-thirds of chief executives across the 30 biggest trusts that formed part of our analysis are men, and all but one of the chain bosses are white. But of the 357 members ofcentral staffthat trusts listed online, our analysis suggests nearly two thirds are women. It s difficult to get comparable figures on the size of these teams, and not all trusts responded to our request for data. Of those that did, unsurprisingly, United Learning the country s largest trust had the biggest central team. Its 230 staff provide services across areas that include payroll, accounts and technology systems for its 81 schools. Services can be delivered efficiently and effectively , with the specialist expertise offered particularly valuable to schools , the trust says. But services are only centralised where doing so is demonstrably efficient and or effective than doing it locally . United Learning says the cost of all these services equates to 234 for each pupil. Of our analysis, just four trusts appear to have 20 or fewer central team members. All are faith-based, including the Diocese of Norwich Education and Academies Trust which has just 11 people in its central team. Oliver Burwood, its chief executive who oversees one secondary and 37 primaries, about half of which have less than 100 pupils says a company performs several back-office roles on its behalf. His trust, with another in the same diocese, launched the firm because they didn t want to replicate a whole load of roles and costs that are already sitting in one MAT . Burwood says it gives them better value for money , as it operates across the two groups. This has allowed his central team to focus on school improvement . At the same time, some members of staff also act as line managers to the chain s executive headteachers, who run federations of up to four small primaries. If you ve got a good leader, it s best to have them across those four schools than having them teaching a lot of the time, he says. You can grow central teams as big as you want, but they ve got to be effective, and they ve got to produce outcomes for pupils. You don t want them to be bloated because, ultimately, it s money that should be spent on kids. Bishop Wilkinson Catholic Education Trust has a 42-person strong central team which Nick Hurn, it chief executive, describes as bigger than most . The group expanded from 10 to 47 schools in just four years. The difficulty we had was matching the required expansion of our services and team with the income that does not come in as quickly as the converted schools, Hurn says. So, you have a funding gap, but still have the extra schools to support. But the NGA concluded two years ago that central team power and influence continues to contribute to ongoing tensions between individual school expression and trust control . Hugh Greenway, the chief executive of the Elliot Learning Foundation, which has 30 central staff for its 32 primaries, describes his team as medium-sized , but adds the trouble with command and control is you take bigger risks . You need people in the field to make decisions. We want to encourage innovation and development. When we see something silly or dangerous being done, we step in. My approach costs because there are areas of duplication and development. Whilerising trust chief executive pay has been well scrutinised, the salaries of other centrally employed staff has not. It is difficult to work out exactly how much central teams get paid. But a good proxy is salaries. Pay scales show headteacherscan earn up to 131,400 this year, although trusts can set their own pay. Using analysis provided by the Campaign for State Education CASE , we found 90 people across the 10 largest trusts earned than 130,000 last year. This equated to 42.57 per child. The CASE analysis found the comparable figure for staff in councils and authority-maintained schools was 4.17. The Harris Federation, for instance, now has 20 people paid than 130,000. Of those, four earn than 200,000. Moynihan received 455,000 last year. But the salaries of the other three Harris leaders who are not named in annual accounts places them in the top 20 of the best-paid CEOs across the country. Harris appears to be an outlier, though. No other large trust has than one person paid than 200,000. United Learning had 25 leaders who received salaries of than 130,000, the second-highest, while Ark Schools had nine. But the trusts say this is not a good indicator of central team wages because most people earning than 130,000 are heads or executive heads working in their London schools. Accounts for the 10 largest trusts over the past six years show the number of employees in that pay banding climbed by two thirds. Over the same period, the chains only grew by 30 per cent. The findings suggest central team growth has outstripped trust expansion. Five chains had no one in the higher bandings. Among them was Oxford Diocesan Schools, which notes its central team salaries are 10 per cent to 20 per cent lower relative to those of other trusts of similar size . A spokesperson says the chain strikes a balance of paying at an appropriate level for high-quality staff and recognising we are custodians of public funding for children s education . And the costs of growing teams doesn t sit well with some. It s about the amount of money that s taken out of schools, says Tarn. My trust is probably one of the most financially efficient in the country. There s a reason why we re spending 15.1 million on school buildings this year, and that s because we generated in 2021 about 15 million surplus. We re not doing that because we re sloshing money about paying people to hybrid work and filling offices with executives. But a survey of 84 trust leaders last week by The Key and Forum Strategy found that budget pressures have forced just over a third to reduce investment in specialist central staff . Central teams are generally funded by one of two ways. In the first and most common trusts collect a percentage slice of each school s budget, or general annual grant GAG funding. Chains using the second method, GAG pooling, collect their schools budgets in one pot before dishing out funds based on their own formula, which doesn t have to be published. Our analysis shows just five of the country s biggest trusts GAG pool. The Diocese of Ely MAT started pooling funding in 2020-21. Accounts state smaller schools have benefited from this approach . The highest top slice was 7.25 per cent, charged by Unity Schools Partnership. Meanwhile, Bishop Wilkinson s accounts show the amounts range from 0 to 5 per cent. Hurn says this allows the trust to make sure it does not take a top slice from schools in financial difficulty until we are able to stabilise them, which can take a year or two . The trust does not GAG pool at this stage in our development as many of our schools have managed to save decent amounts in their reserves . Despite this, heads have all agreed that this money can be pooled and used by the trust if or when necessary to support an ailing academy. Areport by auditors Kreston Reeves this yearfound that nearly 25 per cent of its than 300 trusts GAG pool, compared with 14 per cent last year. Altogether, two in five are either pooling or considering it. REAch2will begin pooling budgets in 2024. The trust, which is England s largest primary-only chain, currently takes a 6.5 per cent top slice. Burwood says his chain is considering GAG pooling slowly because we re doing it in consultation with headteachers to make sure we re doing it right. It will help us to serve a small number of schools that aren t by the current formula. Due to vagaries of postcode, they don t ever seem to have enough money. Alice Gregson, the executive director of Forum Strategy, believes some trust bosses are waiting to see how GAG pooling is working for others before perhaps taking it on themselves . But Robert Farmer, the chief executive of Hamwic Education Trust, says pooled funding can also be a barrier to successful schools joining as they feel they may be worse off . Tarn also thinks it s opaque, arguing that it must be really transparent in order to be fair . Stephen Morales, of the Institute of School Business Leadership, says money can t be taken into the centre and it not be clear where you re putting it But I don t accept the local protectionism of this is my school and I ve got a track record of running it perfectly I don t need a central team to tell me what to do . Don t join a trust then. If you re going to be part of one, you accept everything s done in the interests of the whole, not the one. For trust bosses to ensure their models are efficient, Carter argues they must release capacity for school leadership teams to target educational improvement . The sharing of resources, training, development opportunities, curriculum and assessment systems can and does result in a reduction in workload across MATs. But for this to work, there needs to be a culture where school staff value being part of a trust that leads in this way. They need to be willing to accept that the trust might have capacity and be better placed than their own school to do all of this work in isolation. The academy trust handbook only states that central teams must have an accounting officer who is usually the chief executive and a finance director in place. There is no guidance issued on how they should be configured. Leora Cruddas, who heads the Confederation of School Trusts, describes this as an important point of principle . The whole point of creating a MAT is that it, as a specialist organisation, gets to determine the most effective structure for its group of schools. I would resist to my dying breath any government decision to issue guidance on how they should perform or organise operational functions. It would completely undermine the trust movement.', 'Bosses of trusts wanting to expand are being told by regional directors to get mentoring from other experienced leaders as collaboration comes to the fore in the sector. Schools Weekanalysis ofregional directorboard minutes shows numerous chief executives, chief finance officers and chairs of expanding chains have been advised to secure support since September. The sessions have helped chief executives assess their school improvement capacity and structure their central teams. Some have been put in touch with multi-academy trust chiefs by the Department for Education while others were left to seek out mentors themselves. One expert close to the advisory board process said: It s not a judgement on the leader . We re onto the second- or third-generation CEOs with new people stepping in and their trusts are growing quite a lot, so it s about supporting that so they don t fail or struggle. Regional director advisory board minutes show mentoring support for leaders has been recommended 14 times since September. On four other occasions, it was included as a condition of approval for academy trust expansion bids. The trusts had, on average, nine schools. The southwest issued the advice the most six times since September, while no such recommendations were minuted during meetings in London and the East Midlands. Anthony Guise is set to launch a five-academy trust in September, having run a local authority-maintained school since 2019. He has discussed the practicalities of setting up and securing compliance since being put in touch with Carol Dewhurst, of Bradford Diocesan Academy Trust. I m going from running a school to running a business essentially, he said. Northern Education Trust CEO Rob Tarn, who used to be on an advisory board, added that maintained school heads suddenly get exposed to things they ve never needed any knowledge of when they take on a multi-academy trust. They have to have an external auditor, a risk register, produce monthly management accounts and follow the academies handbook. People can come into CEO roles not even knowing what scheme of delegation means, let alone what the best one is. It was during the talks that Guise learned he wouldn t need to apply for capital funding, as his trust would have than 3,000 pupils so would get it automatically. Dewhurst will also run the rule over Guise s central services plans, too. The mentoring has also extended to his chair. She s going to be observing one of their meetings to see how they re run, he added. Dewhurst s chief financial officer will also attend the interviews for the soon-to-be-formed trust s CFO position to ensure candidates have the technical nous required to fulfil the role . Minutes show that the leaders of two new trusts in the southwest were advised they should be mentored for 12 months to provide them with positive and constructive support . Andrew Minchin, of Beyond Schools Trust BST in Kent, contacted Jon Chaloner, GLF Schools former CEO, after being told in November to consult another multi-academy trust to support the scale of change . The DfE had approved plans for BST to expand from five schools to 10. The pair have since had three sessions, which have been paid for by the trust. Chaloner has looked at the trust s school improvement capacity and functions, but will also advise on the next stage of our five-year strategic plan, which we re going to review and update . Chaloner said one of the key focuses will be helping Minchin to prioritise. Sometimes as CEO you prioritise the issue that is the noisiest at the time. But sometimes you need to step back, and talk it through. In the southwest, Salterns Academy Trust was advised to speak to an advisory board member to understand and learn from experience of overseeing an all-through trust. The recommendation was made as the regional director gave the multi-academy trust, which only consisted of two secondaries, the go-ahead to take on a school that teaches children aged between four and 16. Meanwhile in December, Yorkshire and Humber advisory board members suggested mentoring may be beneficial to TEAM Education Trust CEO Sarah Baker, as they considered plans for her to take on a special school in the region. At the time the chain, which has three east Midlands academies, was also developing two satellites linked to its special school, Stubbin Wood in Mansfield. Baker said the board wanted her to speak to CEOs with experience of taking on multiple projects at once . She linked up with a CEO of a special trust in a different part of the country, so it was non-competitive and the boss of a medium-sized mainstream multi-academy trust. Talking about onboarding the schools has been critical, along with scaling up and when you would be ready to take on the next school or satellite provision. It s also been about the roles you might need in your central team, what you might centralise, and how you develop your staff to work across the trust, rather than going out to recruitment. As part of this, Baker has done work around talent pooling , which focuses on where the next layer of leadership will come from within TEAM. Chief executives are also being talked through subjects such as integrated curriculum financial planning and executive team structures. These attempts by regional directors to nudge leaders towards mentoring are in addition to DfE s attempts to develop the next generation of CEOs. The2022 schools white paperpromised an academy trust chief executive training programme as part of the golden thread of professional development . The National Institute of Teaching s government-backed scheme subsequently kicked off two months ago. Its 12-month course will involve mentoring from up to 25 CEOs. Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said it was very good to see the spirit of professional generosity and collaboration now permeating our sector. There is a real appetite for collaboration among trust leaders , she added. We are richer as a professional community when we work together. Chaloner added that societal shocks in recent years have led people to realise if we work together, we go . Competition means that you can only win at the expense of someone else, whereas collaboration s aim is to uplift each other. To have the next generation of CEOs working together, that can only be for the benefit of our children. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said trusts sharing best practice is a hugely important part of continuously improving the standards of education for children .', 'Leaders fear smaller academy trusts aren t being allowed to grow in England s left-behind areas as MATs bulge in size and standalone academies tumble. Since the governmentunveiled its blueprint to expand, merge or create multi-academy trusts in 55 priority areas, single-trust declines in these towns and counties have outstripped national falls,Schools Weekanalysis shows. Some leaders have argued the push for larger academy chains has helped protect the most vulnerable schools from financial peril. But others worry smaller MATs have been side-lined over England s largest trusts instead of expanding into new areas. Last March,ministers published plans dubbed trust development statements to expand or launch new MATs in 55 education investment areas , which have the nation s weakest results. At the time, the government said the documents clearly signpost the types of growth project we want to encourage to improve outcomes in each EIA. Schools Weekanalysis of government data shows the number of SATs in the EIAs has dropped by 13 per cent over the last year. National drops stood at eight per cent over the same period. Of all the EIAs, Rotherham witnessed the largest fall, with its stock of standalones falling from eight to just one. Looking at regional data, the West Midlands and South East were the only ones not to see a fall in the number of SATs, with numbers remaining the same. Dr Jenny Blunden, who sits on the regional director s advisory board for the south-west, attributed the region s 10 per cent fall in SATs to the fact many are already working with local MATs. Trying to bring together vulnerable trusts to make larger, stronger trusts is a key driver, particularly in a region that s perhaps highly academised than other areas, added Blunden, who also runs 34-school chain Truro and Penwith Academy Trust. Much of this is common sense it s not particularly radical. Any schools standing alone in the southwest have been encouraged, I think, by regional groups to consider working within a group of schools. Trust leaders have long had concerns about secrecy and variability in academy commissioning decisions. But it appears the statements are providing some logic. Minutes from a north-west advisory board meeting in September detail how proposals for St Aidan s CofE Academy, in Darlington, to be absorbed by a MAT were in line with the strategic plan outlined in the statements. The board discussed the ongoing challenges the secondary faces as a standalone . The merger would help support the school and make the necessary improvements . Confederation of School Trusts chief Leora Cruddas said the statements were an attempt to bring greater transparency and consistency on how decisions are made. We are seeing some signs of that, but the picture is not perfect. In the long term, CST wants an independent national schools regulator making these types of decisions, to ensure independence, impartiality, and transparency of regulation . Our figures also reveal that the average size of a trust operating in EIAs has grown by than 11 per cent, from 6.5 schools to 7.2, since the government released the statements. The national figure rose by 9 per cent, from 4.2 schools to 4.6. Improvement areas in Yorkshire and the Humber recorded the highest rise 15.8 per cent , while those in the west Midlands had the lowest 6 per cent . Matt Crawford, CEO of the 19-school Embark Federation in Derbyshire, said interest from schools considering moving into his trust has been higher than ever over the last 12 months. There are now 16 schools hoping to join. He believes his organisation s growth strategy, which will see it populate all six regions of Derbyshire with up to 10 academies, will the DfE s aim of building capacity near the northern and western borders of the county. During a meeting last summer, the north-east advisory board threw its weight behind plans for Eden Learning Trust, which now has eight schools, to take on the Kepier Academy in Sunderland. Members said the application was in line with the aspirations of the development statements, which wanted the city to have fewer, larger chains. To aid Eden Learning with its next stage of growth , members supported regional director Katherine Cowell s recommendation for the CEO and chair to undertake some peer mentoring from experienced colleagues of a larger trust . The statements also outlined the DfE s desire to see high-quality trusts move into some EIAs if they were already operating in neighbouring local authority areas. Rob Tarn, CEO of the 26-school Northern Education Trust, said his team has been in discussions with the government to work in priority areas in greater Manchester , including Bury and Salford. This will increase the number of trust schools in the area from two to eight and we believe this is a good example of strategic decision making to introduce strong trusts into areas where performance needs to improve. Oasis founder Steve Chalke, whose MAT runs 53 academies, stated he is in talks to take on schools in seven EIAs. What happens in reality is a school trust grows through relationships. We began discussions with a local authority they didn t refer to this list of EIAs it was simply them saying look, we have a situation we think you ll be able to help us with . But one advisory board member, who wanted to remain anonymous, said there is some tension between small trusts wanting to grow and the government s strategic wish to engage large MATs in EIAs. They explained there s a feeling they re not allowed to grow as all the opportunities are going to the big ones . The CEO of a smaller trust claimed the department has a very clear view over where they want all investment area primaries and secondaries to go. Those in the North West recorded the highest proportion rise in schools in MATs 12.8 per cent and academy growth 10.5 per cent , while levels in the east of England stood at just 2.6 and 2 per cent respectively. However, the north west has the fewer proportion of academies nationally, while the east of England has among the most. At six per cent, Yorkshire and the Humber EIAs witnessed the largest fall in trust numbers, while West Midlands EIAs registered the largest increase 3.6 per cent . Epworth Education Trust CEO Julie-Ann Hewitt, who runs seven academies across five investment areas, thinks there is a real lack of consistency from councils. While some are keen to collaborate with trusts, she has faced some resistance . Hewitt said: Such barriers mean that it can feel like we are going through the motions of doing the things that are being asked of us, but it doesn t then reach the desired successful or effective conclusion. Former national school commissioner Sir David Carter believes the government s push could be driving many of the conversations around trust mergers. He gave the example of Lincolnshire, one of the 55 areas, where those who have resisted very vocally joining a trust in the past are now thinking strategically to join the trust that is right for them. That has to be a good thing moving forward. The Department for Education said it is still considering the impact of the statements, but the early signs are promising and local partners have welcomed the clarity they have brought . It knows that trusts can benefit from growing at scale , with larger MATS able to generate greater economies of scale that can be reinvested in school improvement . To help deliver on the aims of the statements, the department has also provided an enhanced package of support particularly in EIAs across the rounds of the trust capacity, establishment and growth funds. Strong academy trusts can transform schools that are underperforming, and it is widely recognised that there are clear benefits to being part of a high-quality trust, a spokesperson added.']",Academy trusts and school governance

The Department for Education has ramped up its policy on reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete RAAC to mandate all school buildings with it must now close. This action was previously only taken in the worst cases. It is understood officials learned over the summer of cases where buildings with RAAC collapsed despite not showing any signs of deterioration. Officials have promised schools they will fund any immediate works such as propping up buildings, but funding for longer-term solutions is still unclear.New guidance for schools has also been published. But Labour, unions and council leaders have criticised the 11th-hour intervention. So what do schools need to know? Here s your trusty Schools Week round-up: So far, there are 156 confirmed cases of RAAC in schools. But this is expected to be higher asnot all schools have done surveys to check for it. Of those, 52 have already been supported to put mitigations in place including through additional funding for temporary accommodation and all children will be back in face-to-face learning next week. That leaves 104 schools with no mitigations in place and having to vacate any space or building with RAAC. DfE said a small minority will have to either fully or partially relocate, with most able to remain open for face-to-face learning on their existing site. All affected schools have now been assigned a caseworker from the DfE to help with mitigation plans. A small minority are expected to have to either fully or partially close their buildings, with most able to remain open for face-to-face learning on their existing site. The new guidance points out that if the RAAC is in a small enough area, schools may be able to close the space with minimal disruption . If schools aren t left with enough space to accommodate pupils, they should find temporary accommodation for the first few weeks until the building has been made safe through structural supports . Such accommodation could include local schools, nurseries or colleges, temporary buildings that can be brought on-site quickly or space in community centres or empty office buildings. If it is not safe to use structural supports to make RAAC areas safe, schools will need to procure temporary accommodation on-site. If they don t have the space, they re advised to contact their caseworker. The DfE says it will provide funding for all mitigation works that need capital funding. However this will only be for essential immediate works needed to remove any immediate risk , which could be propping up affected buildings. Government has only said it would work with councils and academy trusts to manage the longer-term work to rid buildings of RAAC, and pointed to the regular capital funding streams available each year and the school rebuilding programme. Bodies and schools who have difficulty funding the extra costs are told to discuss it with their caseworker and the Education and Skills Funding Agency. Schools Week questionedacademies minister Baroness Barran in June about whether RAAC issues would delay the promised 500 school rebuilds. There is some confusion over funding for temporary buildings for those affected. A DfE press release says they will fund this, while the new guidance states schools and councils are expected to fund any additional revenue cost , such as rent for temporary accommodation or transport costs. DfE has been asked for clarification. RAAC has been known about for years. Last September, the Office for Government Property OGP issued a safety briefing notice to all property leaders warningRAAC is now life expired and liable to collapse . Government-commissioned structural engineers have been visiting schools for the past year to assess whether they contain RAAC. Those that did were given a rating from critical to low risk . But government said over the summer it learned of a small number of cases where RAAC failed without warning. This included both education and non-education buildings. Ministers have been content to let this chaos continue for far too long The DfE said today that it is now taking a cautious approach to prioritise safety whilst minimising the disruption to learning . Education secretary Gillian Keegan said this was the right thing to do for both pupils and staff . But shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said it was an absolutely staggering display of Tory incompetence. Dozens of England s schools are at risk of collapse with just days before children crowd their corridors. Ministers have been content to let this chaos continue for far too long. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said leaving this until the end of the summer holidays gives them very little time to make urgent rearrangements and minimise disruption to classroom learning . The LGA has been warning of the risk from RAAC in schools since 2018 , they added, calling for a national RAAC taskforce. Schools that are unsure about the presence of RAAC in buildings have been told to ensure they have contingency plans in place in case the material is confirmed following a survey. They are also advised to do all they can to make settings available to be surveyed, respond to theDfE s questionnaireand not to drill, cut or disturb anything they think may be RAAC. Ministers are working closely with Ofsted to share and make sure it is taken into account in scheduling inspections. If a school is restricting attendance, or has substantial disruption due to RAAC, and have been notified of an inspection, they can contact the lead inspector at Ofsted and discuss deferral options. Schools have also been urged to have contingencies in place in the event exams and assessments are disrupted, in line with thelatest emergency planning guidance. This includes having arrangements for alternative venues. In exceptional circumstances where RAAC disruption has meant leaders need to temporarily prioritise face-to-face lessons, leaders should give priority to vulnerable pupils, the children of critical workers and those about sit exams. Guidance states remote learning should only ever be considered as a last resort and for a short period of time where the alternative would be no education provision . Work provided during these periods should be high quality, meaningful, ambitious and cover an appropriate range of subjects to enable pupils and students to keep on track with their education. Schools should continue to provide free lunches for any pupils not in classrooms and also continue to offer extra-curricular activities wherever possible . If RAAC has taken the usual spaces used for this out of action, schools should consider whether alternative arrangements could be made to deliver the provision safely , such as another school site, local venues or the school s temporary accommodation. While legal duties relating to children with an education health and care plan would still apply, guidance states it may be challenging to deliver the same support, for instance a teaching assistant. If this is the case, the school and council must consider if there are other ways they can meet statutory duties for children. Schools should also consider having phone calls to keep in touch with vulnerable children learning at home. This is particularly important given you may not have seen your pupils during the summer holidays , guidance adds. The government said the local authority or school is responsible for organising alternative accommodation, if needed. They should also agree this with parents of affected pupils . If a parent wants to move their child to a different school, they should make an in-year application through existing admissions processes . But even if a school is in emergency or longer-term temporary accommodation on a different site, the DfE believes that in many cases pupils will be able to remain on the roll of their existing education setting . Where specialist provision such as special schools and alternative provision is impacted, the school should inform the body responsible for commissioning placements as soon as possible. The commissioner, which could be a council or school, will need to consider the impact and duration of the disruption and whether alternative arrangements should be made in the short or long term. As there are varying contexts , specialist schools will require different solutions which the DfE caseworker can advise on. It is likely families of pupils in specialist provision will face additional care issues if they receive temporary home education. It is essential that this is carefully considered, and, where relevant, appropriate support arrangements are made in consultation with local children s social care teams.', 'A minister has vowed to seek expert advice over school leaders grave concerns that visual inspections required by government may not be enough to find hidden RAAC. Senior DfE officials and ministers face being hauled in front of MPs next week to explain their shambolic handling of the reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete RAAC crisis, which exploded last week. The DfEsaid nearly 150 schools, with about 100,000 pupils, had confirmed RAAC as of last Wednesday, with dozens emerging. But the education secretary has remained defiant, despite intense criticism. Gillian Keeganwent on the attack blaming sensationalist media coverageand telling schools to get off their backsides to complete RAAC questionnaires. Academies minister Baroness Barranlater apologised after councils and trusts were wrongly told they had failed to complete the survey. Others were unable to provide about RAAC presence casting doubt on the accuracy of official figures. Barran also vowed to look into concerns that crumbly concrete would not have been picked up by checks. Meanwhile, heads are pleading for marquees and temporary classrooms as back-to-school week has been thrown into chaos. Bridget Phillipson, Labour s shadow education secretary, said: The defining image of 13 years of Conservative government is one of children cowering under steel props, there to stop the ceiling falling in on their heads. The sudden decision to close schools was triggered by three new cases that the department said it became aware of over the summer. Previously, only schools with RAAC assessed as high risk had to close. The first incident was a commercial setting, the second a failed plank at a school in a different country and the third a panel failure at an English school in late August. In all cases, the RAAC had been considered non-critical and collapsed without warning . The DfE refuses to name these institutions or give exact dates of when they became aware as the cases were under investigation . The Guardianreported one of the cases prompted the government s change of approach was Queen Victoria School, a private boarding school in Scotland. However ther DfE said this was inaccurate. The newspaper claims the department sent health and safety officials to examine it in May, calling into question the government s assertions it only became aware of issues over the summer. Barran also told the House of Lords in July two months later that she was absolutely clear the DfE is not aware of any child or member of staff being in a school that poses an imminent safety risk . She is expected to be probed on the timeline of events at a special session of the education committee on September 19. Senior DfE officials are also likely to be recalled to the public accounts committee on Monday, which had closed its inquiry on school buildings over the summer. The last-minute closure decision left headteachers scrambling to draw up emergency plans. Nearly a third had to delay the start of term or educate some pupils remotely. Some heads handed over their own offices to convert into classrooms while waiting for news from the government on temporary teaching spaces. The overflow carpark at Farlingaye High in Suffolk will now house toilet blocks and eight temporary classrooms, with the first being constructed today. Eighteen classrooms, toilets and changing rooms at the school are cordoned off. East Anglian Schools Trust could fork out up to 300,000 in instalments over the next 12 months, with the start of term delayed. The government said it will fund mitigation works to remove any immediate risk , which could including propping up affected buildings. It will also fund capital works such as installing temporary classrooms on site, but will not fund revenue costs like bussing pupils to other schools. The government has since updated guidance to say all reasonable requests for revenue costs will now be funded . In terms of the process of getting the money, I haven t a clue, said Angelo Goduti, the trust s chief executive. Staff are being creative to find space inside the school, with the headteacher s office set to be converted into a makeshift classroom. Nick Hurn, boss of the Bishop Wilkinson Catholic Education Trust, said three of his schools in the north have been forced to close, with Durham University offering space free. But he added: If we have two double-decker buses with 160 kids from one school travelling to a different area, that s soon going to rack up some costs. The South Suffolk Learning Trust needs 28 temporary classrooms to make up for lost space across three of its schools. Sarah Skinner, its chief executive, has secured six for 12 weeks costing 125,000. But, so far, she has had no about how to claim the cash back. Keegan told MPs that the supply of temporary buildings has been increased with their installation accelerated . But so far, no has been made publicly on how this will work. WhenSchools Weekasked DfE for , they said it was still commercially sensitive as contracts are not yet signed. Skinner said: If they re lined up and ready to go, as Ms Keegan said this week, I don t know why I haven t got a date and know how many I can have. Two headteachers at RAAC schools wrote to parents to say they are a priority school and have been bumped up the list for help. Andy Perry, head at Myton School in Warwick, said its DfE contact confirmed we are now a priority school, at the top of the list we are being tracked by some important people in government . Likewise, James Saunders, head at Honywood School in Essex, said the DfE and council has classed it as a national priority school . However, the DfE toldSchools Weekit wasn t a term it recognises causing even confusion. Honywood is now fundraising to cover the costs of remote learning and temporary classrooms raising 2,000 so far. It is among 53 Essex schools with RAAC, the hardest-hit area. Councillor Carlo Guglielmi said Essex was the highest populated area in the country after London was ruined during the Second World War, so many new schools had to be built during the time RAAC was in use. Keegan came under fire this week fortelling schools to get off their backside and fill in a questionnaire on RAAC that has been live since last March. But it then emerged some responsible bodies werewrongly told they had failed to complete the questionnaire. Other trusts were unable to provide updated about the press once of RAAC, while others had to tell the DfE they were missing from the official list. School leaders have also been told there is a 48-hour lag between uploading RAAC data and feeding into DfE lists. During a meeting on Wednesday with than 400 members of the Confederation of School Trusts, Barran offered an unreserved apology for the issues and the tone of a letter that seemed to threaten naming and shaming those who had not responded to the survey. She also gave an assurance that trusts and councils deemed not to have completed the questionnaire will not be named publicly . Keegan has been heavily criticised, including by traditionally right-leaning newspapers. The Sunreported fury at the DfE spending 34 million on refurbishing its own offices, whileThe Mirrorrevealed the DfE handed a 1 million for a IT contract to a company Keegan s husband is a non-executive director of. The money came from its rebuilding fund. However Keegan had no involvement in either of those decisions, and there is no suggestion of wrong doing. Meanwhile prime minister Rishi Sunak has escaped such scrutiny, despite him being the chancellor who refused DfE pleas to provide rebuilding cash amid warnings of a critical risk to life if this programme is not funded . But the education secretarysaid others had sat on their arse as she and the department had been doing a f ing good job . Defending her record in the Commons, Keegan said she was very serious about getting rid of RAAC. The number of surveying companies has increased from three to eight to try and get through all suspected RAAC cases in the next two weeks. Barran has also agreed to seek expert advice about grave concerns that visual inspections of schools may not be enough to find concealed RAAC. Previous guidance encouraged an initial visual inspection by someone who has responsibility for building or estate management as well as the day-to-day running of the school . But depending on experience, advice may be required from a building professional . However it was only once RAAC was suspected or identified that schools were recommended to appoint a specialist structural engineering consultant, and only at stage four of the process was an intrusive investigation recommended. Updated guidance last week when the government escalated its response also recommends an initial visual inspection, but states that if responsible bodies were still unsure after that process, they should appoint an expert. Leora Cruddas, the chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said many confederation members were concerned about the reliability of the DfE guidance and were questioning whether they could rely on it. In response, Barran had offered to take this issue away and seek expert advice. I have asked for the DfE s assessment or risk and reassurance on this matter as soon as possible . Two MPs also raised the issue of asbestos, including fears RAAC was hiding behind the lethal material. In response, Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said all schools had an asbestos register and the substance would be be removed if needed for RAAC mitigation works. Schools Weekrevealed earlier this week how RAAC schools had previous rebuilding work cancelled, while others were turned down for new schools. With the Treasury refusing so far to promise new money to fix buildings, sector leaders are concerned other schools in need of repairs will now miss out as already inadequate capital funding pots are raided. Correction:Keegan s husband is non-executive director of the IT firm, not director. Additions:We added a paragraph to make clear there is no suggestion of wrongdoing from the Mirror or Sun story, and that Keegan had no involvement in either decision. We have reflected in the piece that the DfE rebuts claims made in a quoted Guardian article, after they contacted us post publication.', 'Introduction For the first time since the controversy over algorithm-generated grades in 2020, an education story has dominated the headlines and broadcast media for almost a week. But this isn t the spotlight on education that anyone wanted, not least the Department for Education. The media interest was triggered when, late last week, the DfE issued emergency guidance to schools that were identified as having, or could potentially have, Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete RAAC . RAAC is a type of building material that was commonly used from the 1950s to the mid-1990s and which has since been identified to have serious safety concerns. Last week s guidance from the DfE required all schools to close any spaces this could include cupboards, classrooms or entire buildings in which RAAC has been found. 1 Since that guidance was published, dozens of questions have been asked about what went wrong and what led to the intervention from the DfE, just one day before many schools in England opened their doors or not for the new academic year. There are a number of complex, interacting issues that have led to this and in this blog, we seek to shed some light on those issues and what we should be looking out for next. Timing is key . The public, understandably, want to know who knew what and when, and why the DfE has left it so late in the summer holidays to issue this guidance. Safety concerns associated with RAAC were first flagged in the mid-1990s, following a report by the Building Research Establishment, although it s unclear whether successive governments did anything about the issue in schools following that warning. It wasn t until July 2018 that the DfE published guidance for schools, highlighting the safety concerns associated with RAAC. This was in response to what the DfE has described as a building component failure but which has been reported by the BBC as the falling of a concrete block from the ceiling of a school in Kent. Since the summer of 2021, the has DfE assessed the threat to safety in school buildings as a critical risk , yet the spending settlement from the Treasury fell short of what was needed on that, below and action was not taken until spring of the following year. In March 2022, the DfE sent a questionnaire to schools, asking if they had RAAC on their school estate. Pausing there for a moment, this does beg the question of why the DfE waited almost four years before taking action to identify schools with RAAC. It s reasonable to assume that the Covid-19 pandemic played a part in this delay. From March 2020, the DfE had to respond rapidly and divert considerable resources financial and human to ensuring that pupils were able to continue learning safely during the peak of the pandemic. Of the 156 schools that were initially identified as having RAAC from the March 2022 questionnaire , 52 were supported to put mitigations in place, seemingly based on the DfE s risk assessment at the time. However, following incidents of other building failures caused by RAAC over the summer, the DfE issued guidance on 31 st August to require all schools with known instances of RAAC to vacate the affected area. Not only did this pose considerable logistical challenges for the schools affected, but school leaders have also been frustrated that it happened on the eve of the new academic year, with no warning. The DfE says that it acted on the emerging new evidence i.e. the collapse of structures due to RAAC but again, this raises questions over the quality of advice that the DfE had been receiving up to that point. Why did it take ceilings to collapse for the DfE to reassess the risk? Funding matters The issue of squeezed school budgets, including teacher pay, has been widely reported and debated. But coverage is rarely dedicated to the state of school buildings and the trends in capital funding for schools that is, money allocated to schools for the creation of new places, maintenance, repairs and new rebuilding programmes . The past few days has changed that, as details and analysis has emerged about the trends in capital funding and how that has compared to need. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a detailed analysis of capital funding, but the key reflection from this incident is the importance of heeding the evidence. As the IFS analysis shows, overall capital funding has declined since 2010, largely as a result of the cancellation of the Building Schools for the Future programme that year. 2 The annual average capital expenditure for the past three years to 2023-24 is 5.2bn. This represents a 26 per cent real terms cut compared to the three-year average in the years up to 2008-09 and around a 50 per cent cut compared to expenditure in 2009-10. It should be noted, however, that capital spending rose significantly in the period between 2002-03 to 2009-10 from a relatively low base of just over 4bn per year to a high of just over 10bn per year to fund the BSF programme . The IFS also notes that spending hasn t kept pace with cost, with funding for maintenance and repairs only increasing by 3 per cent in real terms since 2015-16 whereas costs have risen much faster . These trends are in direct contrast with what officials and independent bodies have recommended is actually needed to maintain and repair the school estate. According to the National Audit Office, the DfE recommended back in 2020 that 5.3bn per year was needed in order to maintain schools and mitigate the most serious risks of building failure , with 7bn per year representing best practice levels of funding. Instead, the DfE was awarded 3.1bn per year by the Treasury in the 2020 spending review. 3 The NAO report also states that the DfE has recognised the significant safety risk across the school estate its corporate risk register shows as critical and very likely the risk that building collapse or failure could cause death or injury. and goes on to say that the DfE considers that insufficient capital funding to address structural issues, and the condition of some buildings at the end of their initial design life, contribute to the severity of the risk . There have also been reports by the former Permanent Secretary that, despite the DfE recommending that the school rebuilding programme should be expanded from 100 to 200 schools per year, it was instead cut to 50 schools per year. 4 What do we currently know about the affected schools? At present, there is no official published list of schools that are known to have RAAC but the DfE has committed to publishing a full list, with agreed mitigations, by the end of this week. In the meantime, the BBC has been collating a list of schools that have voluntarily come forward. So far, this totals 79 schools and the reported mitigation actions include moving pupils to other parts of the school estate or neighbouring schools, delaying the start of term for some or all pupils and moving some pupils to online learning. We have run some initial analysis on those schools to explore whether there are any important patterns in relation to their locations, governance and pupil demographics. We share these now as preliminary analysis only which could change once the full set of schools is added to our analysis. Reflections so far The immediate reflection from what we know so far is the importance of forensic and timely risk management, particularly for an organisation as large as the DfE. The risk posed by RAAC came back on to the DfE s radar in 2018, but it took a four years for that to translate into proactive steps to identify schools affected. This raises important questions about what steps the DfE took back in 2018, and whether the Treasury received and assessed any bids for additional funding to address RAAC in schools. The delay in action is likely to have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which would have diverted DfE s resources and focus. Nevertheless, other critical risks, particularly those which pose a threat to public safety, should not have been overlooked. Effective data collection is key to both managing the risk and taking action. At present, we are unable to estimate the level of disruption on schools, pupils and parents because there is a lack of on the number of schools identified and the mitigation actions that have been or will be put in place. The delay in surveying schools also led to structural collapses due to RAAC and an emergency response from the DfE. While there is no question that the DfE was right to prioritise pupil and staff safety, there are lessons to be learned in whether the collection of data and expert advice could have been better managed. Complexities of governance and funding streams may also have contributed to a lack of transparency and, potentially, late identification of problems. The governance arrangement of a school, combined with the number of schools within its trust where relevant , determines how it applies for funding. This means that, in some cases such as with larger multi academy trusts , the DfE doesn t have eyes on how capital is being allocated to or meeting the needs of individual schools within the trust despite the DfE being ultimately responsible for these schools . It also means that there is not a consistent public record of schools that have applied for capital funding to address RAAC or other dangerous structural issues. Most starkly is the issue of missed warnings and opportunities to properly fund school buildings. Every government talks passionately about the importance of schools as places in the heart of communities, yet the warnings of the deteriorating and unsafe school estate even posing a threat to life have not been heeded. The risks to school buildings do not relate solely to RAAC. The NAO estimate that around 38 per cent of school buildings are beyond their estimated initial design life . 5 While this doesn t equate to a critical threat in all cases, many are likely to require maintenance funding and higher running costs. In any case, the need for the DfE to have a laser-light focus on the conditions of the school estate has never been greater. The government now needs to ensure that affected schools have the resources they need to continue to serve their pupils. It has said that it will fund capital costs relating to the mitigation actions that RAAC affected schools will need to take, and it will also meet the costs of full remedial works. In the immediate term, there is a lack of clarity over whether it will fund non-capital costs associated such as transport to temporary sites or rental costs for temporary buildings. The DfE has said schools should discuss individual circumstances with their caseworker. In the longer term, it is unclear where the government will find additional money for the at least 156 RAAC affected schools. After ten years of real term budget cuts, it cannot expect schools to fit the bill, nor would it be palatable to raid the early years or post-16 budgets. Questions must also be asked about how this state of disrepair in the school estate has been allowed to go on for so long and whether capital funding allocated to the Free Schools programme, for example, might have been better routed towards rebuilding and maintenance funding. The government faces a tough set of choices and, sadly, the consequences of not intervening early enough. This incident uncomfortably follows the widespread disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic, from which we are still seeing an impact on lost learning and a widening of the gap between the most disadvantaged pupils and the rest. We cannot allow it to set back any recovery we hope to make.']",School buildings and RAAC safety

Children and young people will be better protected from the scourge of misogynism, deepfake porn and unhealthy attitudes to consent, power and control through newRelationships, Sex and Health Education guidancefor schools being published today Tuesday 15 July . The statutory guidance has a new focus on helping boys identify positive role models, and challenge myths about women and relationships that are spread online in the manosphere - without stigmatising boys for being boys. Secondary schools will also now include lessons on incel culture, including how a piece of content online can impact a person s understanding of sexual ethics and behaviour, as well as increasing awareness of AI, deepfakes and how pornography links to misogyny. It comes as new data published today shows misogynistic attitudes have reached epidemic scale by the end of secondary school. When asked to think about just the past week, over a third 37 of pupils aged 11-19 had heard comments that made them concerned about the safety of girls, and over half 54 said they had witnessed comments they would describe as misogynistic. Other additions to the curriculum include spiking and methanol poisoning, increased focus on resilience and coping, a strengthened health syllabus so children are equipped with necessary knowledge on women s health such as endometriosis and fertility. The guidance builds on the government s commitment to give every school child access to a mental health professional, delivering on the Prime Minister s Plan for Change, and comes ahead of the Violence Against Women and Girls strategy due to be published in the autumn. Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: Before I was elected to Parliament, I managed a refuge for women and children fleeing domestic violence, so I have seen first-hand the devastating impact when we don t foster healthy attitudes from the youngest age. I want our children to be equipped to defy the malign forces that exist online. Schools and parents alike have a vital role to play, helping children identify positive role models and resist the manipulation too often used online to groom impressionable young minds. Whether it s helping deliver on our Plan for Change mission to halve violence against women and girls or growing a just and equal society, there can be no basic mission for a government then making sure our children grow up to become decent, respectful adults, prepared for the modern world. Children will start to build positive attitudes to relationships between friends and family in primary school, followed by new dedicated content in secondary school that helps boys identify positive male role models, and all children to expect consent and kindness when they get ready for intimate relationships. Additional new content for secondary schools includes: Sexual ethics beyond consent, for example teaching young people that yes doesn t always mean yes as factors like peer pressure should be taken into account Staying safe in public spaces, to match staying safe online, so young people know how to increase their personal safety in public spaces, build confidence in trusting their instincts and learn ways to seek help Financial exploitation Positive conceptions of femininity and masculinity A strong new emphasis on age-appropriate and sequenced teaching, differentiated between primary and secondary school, will mean children don t get taught things they are too young for, without proscribing specific ages to each individual topic. The clear dividing line between what can be taught in primary and secondary school remains unchanged. This will allow teachers to sensitively respond to topics that children might have seen online or heard from their friends making sure children are kept safe and parents are informed. Research shows over one in five 22 of girls aged 7 to 10 had seen rude images online , and the average age for exposure to pornography is 13. This is also an issue the sector has regularly raised concerns about, with 3 out of 4 teachers surveyed worrying about the influence of online misogyny over their pupils. That s why, starting in early 2026, schools will be able to apply for an RSHE training grant, empowering the workforce to take on these challenges. Oak National Academy, the publicly-funded provider of curriculum and teaching resources for schools, has released a set of online safety lessons reflecting this part of the guidance that will warn teenagers of the dangers of incel ideology and other forms of misogyny they encounter on the internet. Jason Elsom, Chief Executive of Parentkind, the UK s largest parent charity, said: Transparency is critical for parents and there should be an unambiguous right for parents to see what their children are being taught before they are taught it. This guidance makes it clear that is what should happen. Where parents have been able to view RSHE materials, they are four times as likely to say they are happy with the content of RSHE lessons. Transparency is the word that should be written through every school s approach to RSHE. Parents rightly have high expectations of schools around the teaching of sensitive subjects and doing this in a way that works with parents rather than keeping parents in the dark. John Roberts, Interim CEO of Oak National Academy, said: Teachers have an important role to play in helping children stay safe online and enabling them to identify harms such as incel ideology and misogyny. But it s a delicate topic to cover, and schools need to feel confident they are getting it right. These free, optional Oak resources offer age-appropriate lessons that help teachers start honest conversations and guide pupils towards healthier digital habits and safer online experiences. The guidance is absolutely clear that parents should be able to view all RSHE curriculum materials on request and that schools should not agree to any contractual restrictions on showing parents any content that the school will use. To support children to feel able to take on challenges and risks, they will be taught the importance of grit and resilience and to recognise that anxiety and low mood can be a normal of managing every day mental health. With suicide being the biggest killer of under 35s, the guidance has made clear that secondary schools should work closely with mental health professionals on how to discuss suicide prevention in an age-appropriate way. Andy, Mike and Tim of 3 Dads Walking said: We welcome this vital step forward. Giving schools permission to talk about suicide prevention means young people can be supported to open up about difficult feelings and know where to find help. We know, from painful personal experience, how much this matters. This change will save lives. We re grateful to have played a part in helping bring it about. Schools can begin following the guidance from the new school year and it must be followed from September 2026. Margaret Mulholland, SEND and inclusion specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: Sadly, boys are often exposed to harmful and toxic misogynistic content online, which can impact on their behaviour in the real world. The focus of this updated guidance on tackling these issues is timely and welcome. It is important that we don t simply tell boys what is wrong but that we also talk to them about positive male role models and we are pleased that this is recognised in the guidance. Social media companies must also do to police their platforms to remove harmful material and in particular protect children and young people from malign influences. We all have a responsibility to uphold values of decency and respect. DfE media enquiries Central newsdesk - for journalists 020 7783 8300', 'Proposals requiring families of children subject to protection enquiries to get council consent for home education risk creating an abuser s charter , the government has been warned. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, announced this week that she wouldlegislate for new powers and protectionsfor children in the social care system. Under one proposal, families of children subject to child protection enquiries or plans will need local authority consent to withdraw their children to educate them at home. The law would also give councils the power to require children already in home education to attend school if they become subject to an enquiry or plan. Child protection enquiries are made when councils have reasonable cause to suspect that a child who lives, or is found, in their area is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm . A child protection plan sets out the action that needs to be taken to keep the child safe. Wendy Charles-Warner, of home education campaign group Education Otherwise, said it was perfectly reasonable to require consent for those with child protection plans. But including those who are subject to protection enquiries would lead to any child referred to children s social services for assessment being subject to presumably a school attendance order, regardless of the outcome of that referral . Government data shows there were than 621,000 referrals to children s social services in the year to March 2024, compared to 49,900 protection plans. Charles-Warner said the new law risked becoming an abuser s charter . She added: This will also lead to abusive former partners or individuals seeking to harass families making nuisance-mongering referrals in order to exploit the provision to their abuse and harassment. In its policy paper on the proposals, the government said it would be aided by our plans to enable local authorities to consider the home and any other learning environment when determining whether home education is suitable . Charles-Warner said this appears to be a statement of intent to introduce mandatory home visits and inspections . There is no basis for mandating such meetings, which would invade the privacy of every home-educating family and do nothing to safeguard children. It comes as agrowing number of parents are choosing to educate their children at home. Labour has pledged to create a register of children not in school, and a single unique identifier so children can be tracked across different services. ASchools Weekinvestigation found the rate at which children left the classroom for home education doubled last year, with big increases in some of the country s most deprived areas. A Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel report in May warned that children in home education had died or were abused because the protective factor that school can offer was missing from their lives . Most children in home education were safe, thrive and live happy lives , it added. The panel, which conducts reviews of serious child safeguarding cases, published a report about 27 referrals received between August 2020 and October 2021 about 41 children who were not in school. The children were subjected to sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect . Six children died and the 35 others were seriously harmed . The panel found that home-educated children who were the focus of safeguarding reviews were less visible to safeguarding agencies than those who attend school . Twenty-three children were previously known to social care as children in need or were the subject of a child protection plan. But half of the children appear to have been kept out of sight of any agency . However, home-educating families have increasingly warned that they are being forced to take their children out of school because their needs are not being met. Stephen Kingdom, a former DfE adviser, warned that increasing numbers of parents are forced to home educate because they have been unable to get the support their children need in schools. We also know that failings in social care can lead to parents of disabled children being subject to child protection proceedings rather than receiving the help they need. The government has confirmed that it will extend the duty of councils to promote the educational achievement of looked-after children, children in need and those on protection plans to kinship carers. The role will be carried out by virtual school heads. Ministers will consider whether the extensions to the role of the virtual school head should include a requirement to support all children leaving custody . Phillipson has also announced a crack down on care providers making excessive profits . Several large companies providing social care also run independent special schools.Schools Weekasked the DfE what it expects the policy impact to be on the schooling side of the firms work. It has received no response.', 'New age ratings to be introduced on Relationships, Sex and Health Education content in schools to ensure it is appropriately and sensitively taught. Children will be protected from inappropriate teaching on sensitive topics thanks to new proposals from the government. Following multiple reports of disturbing materials being used in Relationships, Sex and Health Education RSHE lessons, the Department for Education has published updated guidance that will ensure content is factual, appropriate and that children have the capacity to fully understand everything they are being taught. Parents will have the right to see the resources that are being used to teach their children about relationships, health and sex in all circumstances and new age limits will be introduced so that children are not introduced to content they may not have the maturity to understand. Sex education will not be taught before Year 5, and at that point from a purely scientific standpoint. The contested theory of gender identity will not be taught and the guidance confirms copyright law should not be a barrier to sharing curriculum materials with parents with the updated curriculum open for aneight week consultationfrom today 16 May . At secondary school pupils will learn about legally protected characteristics, such as sexual orientation and gender reassignment, but the updated guidance is clear that schools should not teach about the concept of gender identity. In light of theCass Review, it is important that schools take a cautious approach to teaching about this sensitive topic, and do not use any materials that present contested views as fact, including the view that gender is a spectrum. This is in line with the Department s gender questioning guidance, which also takes a cautious approach to assist teachers in ensuring they are acting in the best interests of children. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: Parents rightly trust that when they send their children to school, they are kept safe and will not be exposed to disturbing content that is inappropriate for their age. That s why I was horrified to hear reports of this happening in our classrooms last year. I will always act swiftly to protect our children and this new guidance will do exactly that, while supporting teachers to teach these important topics sensitively and giving parents access to curriculum content if they wish. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said: This updated guidance puts protecting children at its heart, and enshrines parents right to know what their children are being taught. It will support schools with how and when to teach often difficult and sensitive topics, leaving no doubt about what is appropriate to teach pupils at every stage of school. Parents can be reassured once and for all their children will only learn age-appropriate content. Schools should ensure that RSHE teaching materials are available to parents and that parents are aware of what is being taught. New content in the guidance, mirroringletters sent by the Education Secretaryto schools over the past year, makes it clear that schools should make materials available to parents, and clarifies how copyright legislation gives them scope to do so. The guidance also now includes additional content on suicide prevention in the secondary health and wellbeing section, including equipping pupils to recognise when they or their peers need help. The guidance has also been strengthened to help young people to understand the benefits of rationing time spent online and the impact on their wellbeing, and the serious risks of viewing content that promotes self-harm and suicide. Following reports of schools seeing rising levels of harmful misogynistic behaviour, the guidance now includes a dedicated section on sexual harassment and sexual violence, which covers some specific types of abusive behaviour that were not explicitly discussed previously, such as stalking, as well as advice for teachers about how to address misogynistic online influencers. James Grimes, Head of Prevention at Gambling with Lives said: We welcome this guidance as DfE is clearly learning from gambling- deaths and lived experience of addiction. Young people deserve the full picture about the impact of addictive gambling products and the link to mental health harms and suicide. Jason Elsom, Chief Executive of Parentkind: Our 2023 polling of parents relating to sex education revealed the very serious concerns of parents. We are grateful to the time that the Government has given to understanding and addressing those concerns during the past twelve months, and fully support this commitment to ensuring parents are well-informed and actively involved in their children s education when it comes to sensitive topics such as Relationships and Sex Education RSHE . As the first educators of their children, parents deserve full transparency and access to the curriculum and resources used in schools. This initiative to strengthen the partnership between schools and parents will foster a collaborative environment, ensuring that children receive comprehensive, balanced, and well-informed education while respecting parents roles and concerns. We believe that open communication and shared understanding are key to promoting the wellbeing and safety of all children. Dr Alison Penny, Director of the Childhood Bereavement Network said: Most children will face the death of someone important by the time they leave school the big feelings this brings can leave them feeling isolated. Consistent evidence from recent surveys shows that children, young people, parents and teachers support grief education being covered sensitively in school, aligned with children s wider learning opportunities at home. This empowers them to cope with their own experiences, and be better allies for their grieving friends, building a compassionate community around the next generation. Louis Appleby, Chair of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy Advisory Group said: It s vital that young people are able to understand thoughts of suicide or self-harm that they may be feeling, and that schools are confident in addressing this most sensitive of subjects. The new guidance aims to break down the shame that can make it hard to ask for help and, crucially, places an emphasis on safe ways of coping. RSHE is vital in equipping students with the knowledge to make informed and ethical decisions about their wellbeing, health and relationships, setting them up for the future. The updated guidance, which was informed by an independent panel, follows a thorough review by the government in response to disturbing reports that inappropriate material is being taught in some schools. The draft guidance is now open to consultation. When final, the guidance will be statutory and schools will be expected to follow it.

7,128,7_absence_attendance_pupils_year,"['absence', 'attendance', 'pupils', 'year', 'absent', 'sessions', 'rates', 'persistent', 'school', 'autumn']","['When welast lookedat absence at the end of Autumn Term, we found a slight improvement at secondary compared with the previous Autumn, and little to no change at primary. We did note though, that persistent absence among the youngest pupils, those in Reception and Year 1, seemed to have increased a little. Now that we ve got data for the whole of Autumn and Spring Terms, we re going to see whether these patterns held. And with Key Stage 4 exams beginning next week, we ll also take a closer look at Year 11. As usual, data for this post comes from ourFFT Attendance Trackerschools around 6,000 primary and 2,500 secondary schools across England. For this year s data, we ll be looking at the period from the beginning of September up until Friday 5th April. Last year had an earlier Easter holiday, so this data ends a week earlier on Friday 29thMarch. We ll begin by updating our weekly absence chart. Here, we show the average percentage of sessions missed each week this year at primary and secondary the darker shade , and compare with the equivalent weeks last year the lighter shade , and with termly pre-pandemic averages the grey dotted lines . Overall, at both primary and secondary, weekly absence in Spring Term tended to be lower than the equivalent week last year, typically by around half a percentage point in the first half-term, and around one percentage point in the second. Absence in the final week of term, however, was unusually high. Breaking the data down by the reasons for absence recorded in schools registers illness, other authorised 1 , and unauthorised we see that this is driven by a spike in other authorised absence . This is due to the relative timing of Eid al-Fitr, which fell during the Easter holidays last year, but during term-time this year. We see a similar spike last year in June in the same week as Eid al-Adha. Now let s aggregate these weekly rates across the whole of Autumn and Spring Terms. At both primary and secondary, absence so far this year has been very slightly lower than the same period last year. This has been driven by a 0.3 percentage point reduction in absence coded as illness, counteracted somewhat by a 0.1 percentage point increase in authorised absences not coded as illness. Unauthorised absence remains than double pre-pandemic rates at secondary, though has fallen by around 0.1 percentage points since last year. Let s turn now to persistent absence the percentage of pupils who have missed at least 10 of sessions. Across Autumn and Spring terms, this is roughly equivalent to between two and a half and three weeks of school. In all year groups apart from Reception and Year 1, persistent absence either stayed the same or decreased slightly compared with last year. The difference between this year and last year for Reception and Year 1 pupils has decreased slightly sinceAutumn s update. Overall, in our Attendance Tracker primary schools, 15.5 of pupils were persistently absent this year compared with 15.7 last year, and in our secondary schools, it s 23.6 this year vs 24.6 last year. Therelevant pre-pandemic national figuresare 8.4 at primary and 12.7 at secondary. To see whether these same patterns are mirrored across the country, we plot persistent absence by region. As is the case nationally, almost all regions show a small drop in persistent absence at primary and secondary, with a slightly larger drop at secondary. The exception is London, where persistent absence at both primary and secondary increased by one percentage point though London remains the region with the lowest persistent absence at secondary . At secondary, the regions with the highest persistent absence rates last year tended to see larger drops than the regions with the lowest rates. This, combined with rates in London having increased slightly, has narrowed the range between regions to just three percentage points, the same as the range at primary. To finish, we re going to take a closer look at persistent absence in Year 11. Again, we ll plot persistent absence by region the top panel but, this time, we ll also split it by disadvantage the bottom two panels . As usual, we ll measure disadvantage using the variable FSM6 , indicating that a pupil has been eligible for free school meals in the last six years. Around 27 of pupils in our Attendance Tracker schools were disadvantaged. As was the case for all secondary pupils, persistent absence among those in Year 11 fell slightly in all regions apart from London, where it rose though London again remains the region with the lowest rates . Changes from last year were also similar for both disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils, with small drops for both groups across all regions apart from London. The gap in persistent absence between disadvantaged Year 11 pupils and their peers varies substantially by region. In London this year, the gap was around 19 percentage points, compared with 30 percentage points in the South East. This difference is driven by disadvantaged pupils in the South East being much likely to be persistently absent than disadvantaged pupils in London. This is not a new phenomenon. Disadvantaged pupils in London had lower persistent absence rates than disadvantaged pupils in other parts of the country before the pandemic too. In 2018 19, across the whole academic year, 18 of London s disadvantaged secondary school pupils were persistently absent compared with 26 in other parts of the country . However, with persistent absence rates having increased so much during and after the pandemic, the percentage point differences involved are higher. Overall, the story is a familiar one. Absence seems to have come down a little this year compared with last year, though remains some way above pre-pandemic levels. The improvements on last year are driven by a small reduction in absence coded as illness- , though we re still seeing around 30 of this type of absence than we were before the pandemic. The biggest difference compared with pre-pandemic is still unauthorised absence at secondary, which remains than double pre-pandemic rates. Persistent absence among Year 11 pupils, particularly disadvantaged Year 11 pupils, remains high, though has improved since last year in almost all regions.

The education secretary wasin the newsstressing the importance of good attendance at the start of the year thoughwe thinkit s not any important than good attendance at any other time ,schools were givenattendance data for prospective pupils before they joined for the first time, and this week theDfE announcedthe introduction of minimum attendance targets for schools. Now, with half a term of data under our belts, let s see whether there are any early signs of improvement. As usual, we ll be using attendance marks from around 10,000 schools subscribed toFFT Attendance Tracker, looking at the period up to and including Friday 24thOctober. We ll also calculate some headline figures for last academic year, again using data from our Attendance Tracker schools, and compare with previous years usingDfE official statistics. The last time we wrote anabsence update, covering Autumn and Spring terms last year, we saw a small reduction in absence and persistent absence compared with the previous year. Now, let s complete the picture by including Summer term. Below, we plot the percentage of sessions missed due to absence, and the percentage of pupils persistently and severely absent missing 10 and 50 of sessions, respectively . At both primary and secondary, the picture remains the same as in Autumn and Spring a small improvement in both the percentage of sessions missed and the percentage of pupils persistently absent, but both rates remain above pre-pandemic levels, particularly at secondary. Rates of severe absence have increased at secondary, and remained static at primary thoughwe wrotelast month that the absolute percentages of pupils severely absent may be overstated . We provide the same by year group, below. Improvements in absence and persistent absence in all year groups are small aside from Year 1, where we think rates may have nudged up . At primary, improvements are slightly bigger among older pupils than younger, while at secondary, the reverse is true. For severe absence, increases appear to be larger among younger pupils than older at both primary and secondary, though as with all figures involving small changes in small numbers, we d caution against over-interpreting these patterns. Moving on to this year. Below we plot the percentage of sessions missed by pupils each week, and compare with the same week last year. We see an almost identical pattern to last year at both primary and secondary. Absence at primary was high in the first week of term, before falling and levelling off, then increasing again in the lead-up to the half-term break. At secondary, absence increased rapidly across September, before falling slightly, followed by a big increase in the week before the break. If you re curious about the big peaks just before Easter and after May half-term last year, these are driven by both Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha falling in term-time, and enhanced by the usual uptick in illness and unauthorised absence we tend to see in the weeks immediately before and after school holidays. The overall percentage of sessions missed at both primary and secondary is the same so far this year as the same period last year: 4.7 at primary and 7.3 at secondary. Although the overall percentage of sessions missed has remained the same, perhaps there have been changes in the types of absence recorded. Below, we plot the percentage of sessions missed in the first half-term of this year and last, broken down by the reason recorded in schools registers. We use three categories: unauthorised, authorised for illness- reasons, and other authorised absences. Again, the picture is one of similarity. There s been a very small reduction in illness- absence at primary, which has been cancelled out by a small increase in non-illness- authorised absence, but in both cases the size of the change is less than 0.1 percentage points. There s also been a similarly sized reduction in unauthorised absence at secondary, though this is lost in the chart to rounding. With much of the DfE s focus on attendance being on the transition between primary and secondary, particularly for disadvantaged pupils, we create a second version of this chart for Year 7 pupils only, broken down by FSM6 status indicating whether a pupil has been eligible for free school meals at any point in the last six ish years . There doesn t appear to have been any change in absence overall, or by type. Disadvantaged Year 7 pupils remain around twice as likely to miss school for any reason as non-disadvantaged Year 7 pupils, and around three times as likely to miss school for unauthorised reasons. It s too early to draw any conclusions about persistent absence, with four days of absence across the term enough to put pupils in this category. We therefore calculate the figures for completeness only. We ll have a better idea of what s actually happening at the end of the term, when we ve got data. Overall then there s been no change in absence levels so far this year compared with last. All types of absence remain stubbornly high above pre-pandemic levels, particularly unauthorised absence at secondary. Perhaps somewhat concerningly, given the DfE s focus on narrowing the disadvantage gap at the transition between Year 6 and 7, there doesn t seem to have been any improvement here either. That s not to say that the various initiatives to tackle absence haven t worked. It s just that we can t see any evidence of them having workedyet.', 'Schools can track, analyse and compare their attendance data against 1,000s of other FFT schools using Aspire Attendance Tracker. Log in to Aspire to access Attendance Tracker log in here. Not an FFT Aspire user?Learn here. The return to school this year has been accompanied bya renewed pushon attendance by the Government. When we last looked at attendance,in early November, the picture was similar to the same period the previous year. Though absence was down slightly at primary, and up slightly at secondary. And both absence and persistent absence remained above pre-pandemic norms. In this post, we ll see how the rest of the term panned out. As usual, the data is from schools using Aspire Attendance Tracker around 2,700 secondary and 7,200 primary. Let s start by looking at the average percentage of morning and afternoon registration sessions missed due to absence in each week of the Autumn Term. To see how things compare with last year s Autumn Term, we ll add the equivalent weeks percentages in a paler shade. We can see this year s absence tracked last year s quite closely in the first half-term, but after that, the lines diverge. November and, particularly, December in 2022 saw big increases in absence toward the end of term. While absence did increase this year as term wore on, the week-on-week increases were much less dramatic with the exception of the final week of term, where there was an equally steep uptick this year . Across the whole term, primary pupils missed an average of 5.6 of sessions compared with 6.7 last year, and secondary pupils missed 8.7 compared with 9.3 last year 1 . For context,in Autumn 2019, primary pupils missed 4.3 of sessions and secondary pupils 5.6 . So at primary, absence this Autumn Term was around 1.3 percentage points higher than pre-pandemic norms, and at secondary around 3.1 percentage points higher. To see what s behind these year-on-year changes, we ll look at the reasons for absence recorded in schools registers. Specifically, we ll look at the proportion of sessions recorded as illness- absences, authorised absences not to illness, and unauthorised absence. In the year, the proportion of unauthorised absence will be inflated somewhat as schools will still be chasing up reasons for the most recent absences. At both primary and secondary, the main driver for the reduction in absence this year is a reduction in illness- absence from 4.4 of sessions last Autumn to 3.2 this Autumn in primary schools, and from 4.9 to 4.0 in secondary schools. When comparing this Autumn with pre-pandemic, the picture is less clear-cut. At primary, there was a bit illness- absence than in Autumn 2019 0.6 percentage points , and a bit unauthorised absence 0.6 percentage points . At secondary, there was a bit illness- 0.9 percentage points and a lot unauthorised absence 2.8 percentage points . Now let s see how weekly absence varied by region. Firstly, for primary pupils: Broadly, most regions mirror the national picture of absence steadily increasing through the second half-term this year, with rates far below the same weeks last year. Not all regions saw the sharp uptick in absence in the last week of term though in fact, this seems to have been mostly confined to the south of the country, with London and the South East worst affected. Looking now at secondary pupils: Here, almost all regions share the same pattern absence increased steadily as term went on, at a slower rate than the same period last year, and increased sharply in the final week of term. Moving on to persistent absence. Here we ll plot the proportion of pupils who missed at least 10 , 20 and 50 of sessions in Autumn Term the equivalent of around 7, 14 and 35 days off, respectively 2 . Again, we ll compare with last year s Autumn Term. Similar results in the previous section, persistent absence was lower this Autumn Term than last at both primary and secondary, with primary seeing bigger improvements than secondary. However, there has been less of an improvement at the higher thresholds than the lower. In particular, the proportion of pupils who missed at least 50 of sessions sometimes referred to as severely absent pupils seems to have increased. We d sound a note of caution about that result for now though, as we suspect this year s data contains pupils who left their schools over the summer but were only taken off-roll this year. While this is typically only a small number of pupils, their presence has a large effect when discussing small percentages. At both primary and secondary, persistent absence remained some way above pre-pandemic in Autumn 2019, 11.2 of primary and 15.0 of secondary pupils missed at least 10 of sessions . Let s now look at how persistent absence varied across the country. Here, we ll focus on the 10 threshold. First, we ll plot the percentage of primary pupils who were persistently absent in each region. There s not much difference between the regions with the highest rates of persistent absence the North East and West Midlands with 18.1 and the lowest the South West with 15.8 . But while all regions saw reductions in persistent absence, some saw bigger changes than others. For example, in London persistent absence dropped by 6.9 percentage points compared with 3.3 percentage points in the North East. Moving on to secondary: Like at primary, most regions had similar rates of persistent absence this year there was only a 2.3 percentage point difference between seven of the nine regions. The North East, with the highest rates, and London, the lowest, were exceptions. All regions saw drops in persistent absence compared with last year. Absence rates this Autumn Term are lower, on average, than last Autumn Term, with bigger reductions among primary pupils than secondary. This is driven almost entirely by reductions in absence coded as illness. The reduction in absence for primary pupils is so large in fact, that average absence is now only around a percentage point higher than pre-pandemic. It remains to be seen whether this will hold as the year progresses, particularly as there s still two months of winter to get through. And rates of persistent absence are still stubbornly high, both at primary and, particularly, secondary.

Schools Week sannual executive pay investigationreveals most trusts under government scrutiny froze or slashed pay last year but others handed out significant rises. Some experts and leaders welcome new government scrutiny of pay outliers , but warn that metrics must be nuanced and action taken on stark gender pay gaps. Schools Weekanalysed the 2021-22 accounts for 246 trusts previously ordered by the government to justify having one 150,000 or two 100,000 salaries, and 31 large trusts known to pay 150,000 or . The Department for Education stopped sendingwarning lettersin 2020 following data errors, but last month officialssignalled a new focus on outlier levels of leadership pay across similar academy trusts . No details have emerged on the definition of similar , but some experts say size often provides a good predictor of pay. The DfE says larger trusts generally equate to bigger responsibilities . Our analysis found a moderate correlation between pay and pupil numbers. Yet 50 trusts 18 per cent paid their chief executive 15 per cent above the average even among similar-sized trusts under scrutiny over high pay. The 10 biggest outliers on this measure received on average than 50 per cent 108,000 than expected for trusts their size. They are all also among the highest-paid, earning 195,000 or . They include Sir Kevin Satchwell, the leader of the standalonehigh-performing Thomas Telford School and linked Thomas Telford MAT. His 290,000 minimum earnings down on last year are almost twice expected levels, based on pupil numbers. The trust did not comment. The Harris Federation s Sir Dan Moynihan, the country s highest paid leader on 455,000, earned 60 per cent than the 284,000 wage the model predicts given his 51 schools. The turnaround trust recently celebrated the highest results of any large MAT in Progress 8 league tables, however, while Moynihan has helped raise millions for its schools. It did not respond to request for comment. Doug Selkirk, chief executive of the 15-school Central Learning Partnership Trust, was paid 203,000, around a third above the expected salary based on size. But seven of its 15 academies are special schools. Phil Williams, the trust s chief financial officer, said per-pupil figures were skewed for special and new schools, with size too narrow a set of parameters . He said phase, specialist provision, school challenges and central team size should also be factored in. Such complex cases and the government s past blanket approach raise questions about how sympathetic and nuanced its new clampdown will be. Leora Cruddas, who leads the Confederation of School Trusts CST , said boards set pay very carefully . But trusts vary widely in their size, type, and complexity , making wage variation unsurprising. Emma Knights, chief executive of the National Governance Association, added the government was undertaking a very thorough analysis of what an outlier might be , and welcomed the focus. She said boards and the sector needed to consider whether hiking chief executive pay as trusts grew was reasonable given this is public money . She suggested boards consider pay ratios as a cap or brake on endless rises with growth . But Helen Stevenson, director of the recruitment company Satis Education, said applicants to CEO posts often had higher salary expectations than boards. That s always going to be a challenge until the government tackles outliers. Most boards accept it s a market-driven sector now, so you have to make yourself appealing. Yet some trusts previously criticised over salaries could be seen as outliers for relatively low pay. Sixty-eight trusts of wide-ranging sizes paid than 15 per cent less than other trusts written to by government of comparable size. The 252,000 salary of Sir Jon Coles of United Learning is the seventh highest nationally, but 27 per cent below expected for the country s largest trust. Sir Martyn Oliver of Outwood Grange Academies Trust was similarly below expected, despite earning 180,000. Both also rank as the two lowest-paid per pupil, with Coles wages equating to 4.65 per head and Oliver s 6. Nine other trusts ranked below 10, whereas 80 trusts ranked than 50 per pupil. A spokesperson for the Meridian Trust, where Mark Woods 130,000 salary is 60,000 less than expected for a 28-school trust, said this reflected its use of maintained school pay scales, with an additional 10 points at the top given MAT leadership responsibilities. Three of the lowest outliers are Christian trusts. Stevenson said the Catholic sector often offered lower salaries, seeing roles as mission-led , but she warned it risked losing good-quality leaders . Avearge salaries of female leaders were about 1,000 higher year-on-year, while men s were near-flat. Yet a pay gap of about 14,000 remains among the higher-paid, and only 30 per cent of chief executives analysed were women compared with 76 per cent of teachers. Nineteen of the 50 outliers for lower pay were women versus 14 of the 50 higher-pay outliers . Only four women made the top 20 best-paid, and three because they were receiving salary in lieu of pension contributions. Cruddas said the relative lack of female leaders was disappointing , while Stevenson urged female job applicants to seek advice on sector salaries rather than accepting what s presented . Viv Porritt, the leader of the campaign group WomenEd, said the sector had not treated inequitable pay gaps seriously . The gap between striking teachers and rising salaries for men at the top must be tackled by the sector and by government. Thirty-five leaders were earning at least 200,000, up from 27 in 2018-19. Ten earned 250,000 or . On average, the trusts run by 200,000-plus earners run 27 schools. However, data for another two trusts paying over 200,000 last year was unavailable, including Holland Park School in London whose 280,000 salary for Colin Hall, its former head, made it the highest-paying standalone academy. The school is now part of United Learning following government intervention over high pay and allegations of a toxic culture. A Loxford Schools Trust spokesperson said only 88,178 of Anita Johnson s 240,000 salary was for her role as chief executive, with the rest relating to her headteacher role. Including only the first element would slash her per-pupil CEO cost from 34 to 12, while using combined figures makes comparison invalid and inaccurate , they claimed. Leigh Academies Trust and Delta Academies Trust chief executives Simon Beamish and Paul Tarn respectively received the biggest hikes in pay among the top 20, with rises of about 25,000. A Delta spokesperson called Tarn an exceptional leader of a very high-performing, non-selective trust , making his performance and benchmarking-based pay excellent value . Overall, 11 trusts had top earners on minimum pay bands at least 20 per cent higher than the year before. The Diocese of Chelmsford Vine Schools Trust hiked Emma Wigmore s minimum pay band by 30,000 to 120,000. A spokesperson said its pay committee had reviewed benchmarking data from similar-sized MATs and her performance. Two in five trusts boosted current or new leaders pay overall, with average rises of 8 per cent. It came in a year when most teacher payscales were frozen, and long-standing pay restraint has contributed to industrial unrest. Parents and the public would not expect pay to continue to increase whilst the pay of classroom teachers continues to be held down, said Dr Patrick Roach, the general secretary of teachers union NASUWT. While pay rose 2 per cent on average among the top 20, it was virtually unchanged year-on-year among all the trusts analysed. The average pay was 151,000 still above the 137,000 average in a wider CST trust survey. Forty-four per cent of trusts froze executive pay and 15.5 per cent cut it, with declines averaging 18 per cent. DfE analysis also suggests about 40 per cent of teachers received pay rises in the same year despite frozen payscales. Satis said senior salaries overall were starting to level off , with boards taking government concern over the 150,000 figure seriously . Washwood Heath appointed new chief executive Peter Weir on 110,000, where his predecessor once earned 175,000. A spokesperson said it followed a complete revitalisation of the trust, with new trustees and leadership. Steve Kenning s minimum earnings at Aspirations Academy Trust fell from 250,000 to 230,000, while the pay of five of the best-paid 20 was frozen. The Elliot Foundation s Hugh Greenway said his 214,000 salary was frozen on unions recommendation, but as an interested party he should not comment . Sacred Heart Catholic School s long-standing head in south London, Serge Cefai, ranked most expensive per pupil among majority-mainstream trusts on 145,000. But a spokesperson said his replacement at the single-academy trust earned less following Cefai s retirement. Cruddas also highlighted recent CST research suggesting average trusts pay leaders less than their charity, public and private sector peers. Jason Elsom, the chief executive of Parentkind, said running large MATs was no different , overseeing large workforces and budgets. Yet CST research showed trust leaders surveyed handled budgets and staff far smaller than their charity peers. Inside Housing found housing association CEO pay averaged 193,000 last year, up 1.8 per cent, while the Health Service Journal found 19 NHS leaders earned than 250,000. Elsom added: Trustees should recognise parallels should continue when things go wrong. When a commercial entity is financially constrained, or failing to meet its objectives, the fallout impacts the CEO. Trust was taken from 2021-22 accounts. Trust data varies, with actual pay data used where available but minimum pay band data used where not. Some accounts listed pupil and school numbers from 2022, but others used 2021 data. When neither was available,Schools Weekused DfE databases. Additional reporting by Lauren Wright.', 'Forty-four academy trust CEOs have now crossed the 200,000 pay threshold amid wage rises of up to 50 per cent in five years as leaders argue that salaries may now match those in private firms. Three leaders now earn over 300,000. Schools Week sannualchief executive pay investigationreveals that trust bosses received, on average, a 5.2 per cent hike in 2022-23, taking them out of a period of wage stagnation . Our analysis has found the best paid are getting better paid, but there is also a 14,000 gender pay gap. Meanwhile we can reveal the Department for Education will resume its policy of naming and shaming the trusts under government scrutiny over high pay. National Governance Associationdeputy CEO Sam Henson warned that trustees must remain conscious that salaries are paid from public money . He added: Given the charitable nature of an academy trust, we have always said the pay package will rarely be as high as what is given in the corporate for-profit sector. These recent findings show that may no longer be the case. We analysed the 2022-23 accounts for about 400 trusts with at least one member of staff earning 100,000 or . This included those previously ordered by the government to justify executive salaries, and MATs with 10 or schools. Harris Federation CEO Sir Dan Moynihan again topped the list. His minimum salary rose for the first time since 2018-19, from 455,000 to 485,000 in the last academic year. His supporters point to how he has helped raise millions for the chain. The trust has two other unnamed members of staff earning between 230,000 and 250,000. Dr Dayo Olukoshi, of Brampton Manor Trust, and Leigh Academies chief Simon Beamish joined Moynihan in the top three. Olukoshi, who runs two schools in London, has seen his pay packet grow from 234,274 in 2018-19, to at least 310,000 last year. Meanwhile, Beamish s remuneration figure is at least 305,000, up by 80,000 in five years. Sir Kevin Satchwell, leader of the standalone high-performing Thomas Telford School and linked Thomas Telford MAT, also joins the 300,000 club. In all, 44 chief execs broke the 200,000 barrier, up from the 35 recorded last year. Audits of the trusts accounts show average earnings among their CEOs stood at just over 201,000 in 2018-19. This has since risen 16.5 per cent to almost 235,000. Four recorded increases of 40 per cent or over the period. On average, the trusts run by 200,000-plus earners oversaw 26 schools. Cranford Community College, in Hounslow, was the only single-academy trust in the top 20. Chief executive Kevin Prunty s remuneration rose by 50 per cent, from a minimum of 150,000 to 225,000. Jenny Lewis, chair of the trust s board, said Prunty had been contracted to turn around the fortunes of one of its subsidiaries, Cranford Community Trading Company Limited, after it had been rocked by Covid. He received than 76,000 in wages and backdated pay last year for this. The firm runs all commercial events and activities on the academy site But the business profit, after costs, has tripled following his appointment in September 2021 , generating an extra 105,000. This was a very wise value-for-money decision by the academy trust. Our audit last year found that wages rose by 2 per cent among the 20 highest paid and were virtually unchanged year-on-year across all the trusts. The Kreston accountancy group annual report, which studies the accounts of about 300 academy trusts, noted that there had only been very modest increases or stagnation in pay in 2021-22. But of those surveyed this time around, average pay has increased by 5.2 per cent, from 144,000 to 151,700. Teachers last year got a 5 per cent pay rise. Henson added that the number of bosses breaking the 200,000 barrier needs examination. Is this reflective of some trusts getting bigger and merging, or is it the systemic result of a race to the top, where irresponsible benchmarking gives rise to an ever-upward trend? Many boards would rightly argue that one of the best things they can spend money on is the very best leader, but this must be proportionate and respectful of the fact this is public money. TheEDSK think tank has called for mandatory CEO pay scales, which would cap salaries at 263,000 and fine those who do not follow it. Of the CEOs from the 20 largest MATs, three were given hikes of 10 per cent or , our analysis suggests. Four remained in the same banding, while pay fell in only one of the trusts. Henson said there was a fine balance that has to take priority affordability in a sector that is facing a crippling financial situation, while still being able to attract and retain the right levels of talent . In comparison, housing association CEO pay rose by 5.1 per cent to 164,589, according to Inside Housing. NHS guidance proposes wages of about 265,000 for those running its largest trusts. However, a recent Health Service Journal investigation revealed that five now earn than 300,000. Almost three-quarters of the chains analysed reported rises of some kind. The highest was at 15-school Synergy Multi Academy Trust, where Robert Martlew s remuneration rose nearly 59 per cent from 85,000 to 135,000. A MAT spokesperson said its pay bands and remuneration are in line with Norfolk County Council s as well as the schoolteachers pay and conditions, national pay awards and the academy trust handbook. Despite this, the Confederation of School Trusts CST s executive salary survey for 2023, published in August, noted that CEOs saw a smaller increase year-on-year compared with the total for all senior staff, which stood at an increase of 6.3 per cent . One trust leader, who did not want to be named, suggested this could be due to the recent proliferation of benchmarking data available and a desire among some to avoid PR disasters . We doubled in size in a short period. If we did ours linked to growth, it would look crazy, they added. Thirty-three trusts also reported reductions in the earnings of their top earners. Three saw wages fall by 30 per cent or . Of these, one had a leader leave during the year, while the others welcomed new ones at the start of the academic year. Helen Stevenson, director of recruitment company Satis Education, said roles previously held by founding chief execs have been readvertised not quite at the same level . Our figures suggest that Jacqueline Valin, of Southfields Multi Academy Trust in southwest London, received the highest pay packet per pupil 153.95 child last year. The chain consists of one secondary which has than 1,200 youngsters on its books and a special school for those with multiple health needs. Unsurprisingly, those with the lowest pay-per-pupil numbers ran the biggest trusts. United Learning Trust CEO Sir Jon Coles, whose organisation was in charge of 83 academies last August, earned 4.20 for every child in his schools. Neither trust wanted to comment. Just under 35 per cent of the trusts analysed had female chiefs, up from 30 per cent last year. But of the 27 trusts paying 220k or , just six 22 per cent are women. On average, men were remunerated to the tune of 157,000. Women tended to receive about 14,000 less. Vivienne Porritt, of WomenED, said it highlights wider inequities between men and women in the sector. Trusts should remove the current salary question from application forms and ensure their gender pay gap reports form an action-orientated plan to reduce wage disparities, she added. The government used to write public letters demanding justifications from trusts that paid their leaders than 150,000. But the clampdown has been in limbo since mid-2020. However, the Department for Education s academy sector accounts noted that it was challenging leaders over wages where they are identified as high compared to similar trusts. In response to a freedom of request, the DfE said officials recently engaged with a number of trusts on levels of pay as it bids to improve the quality, depth and transparency of such data. The DfE refused our request for the names of the groups under scrutiny as the will be published in the coming months suggesting that it will return to its name and shame policy. Schools Weekhas revealed how the government will now focus on pay outliers as opposed to just those earning over a certain threshold. Our figures show that 77 trusts 19 per cent paid their leaders 15 per cent or than expected for trusts with a similar number of pupils. Olukoshi s remuneration was the biggest outlier. It was than double 111 per cent expectations. Meanwhile, 97 leaders 24 per cent were receiving at least 15 per cent below what they were due. Mark Greatrex, whose pay packet for running 11-school Bellevue Place Education Trust was 22 per cent under, thinks he is at the lower end of the scale because his MAT is primary only. But he warned that a lot of trusts also appoint for the organisation they re growing into before they ve got there . CST CEO Leora Cruddas said it was difficult to fairly compare roles across organisations, particularly as trusts grow. She added: There is a clear requirement for trust boards to follow a robust evidence-based process in deciding executive pay, and it is right that there is transparency over how public money is used. Greatrex said many trusts use CST s surveys and Kreston reports as benchmarking guides. The DfE, meanwhile, does not hold data on the pay for all executive positions . Government guidance, updated in November, outlined that trust academic performance, finances, educational challenge and the individual s experience should be considered when setting salaries. It also suggested contacting similarly sized trusts in your area to share . However, the NGA remains worried that not enough trusts are talking about pay ratios and using this in their considerations, as much as benchmarking against other executives pay . Henson said: The money that goes into executive pay, the less goes into investment directly into pupils. This emphasis on transparency should be a useful starting point for any trust when considering its pay ratio: can the trust justify to the rest of its community that the ratio between the pay of the senior executive leader and other staff is appropriate? A department spokesperson said that salaries should be justifiable and reflect the individual responsibility alongside local retention and recruitment needs . They added: We will continue to engage with trusts on pay where it is neither proportionate nor directly linked to improving pupil outcomes. School and pupil numbers were drawn from open academies and school census figures. We measured the differences in CEO pay by comparing minimum remuneration levels of the highest earner listed in 2022-23 trust accounts. When a chief executive changed mid-year, we took the largest banding listed in higher-paid staff tables. In all, four trusts appear not to have released accounts for last year.', 'Schools are having up to 28 per cent shaved off their budgets by academy trusts that pool their funding, an investigation has found. Unions are now demanding greater scrutiny over how trusts pool budgets known as general annual grant GAG pooling as leaders await promised government guidance to support decisions around the controversial practice. Schools Weekanalysis of 15 MATs that employ GAG pooling found dozens of schools with budgets that are 15 per cent less than allocated by the government s national funding formula. The retained cash is used to fund trust central teams, services provided back to schools or to bump up funding of other schools in the MAT. Trusts say pooling allows them to save schools money through economies of scale. And redistributing cash to struggling academies means some can actually get than allocated by the government. But school finance expert Micon Metcalfe said there should be disclosure around the funding model. The public generally should have a right to know that funding that is allocated to those children in those schools, if it s not going directly to them, isn t having a detrimental impact, she said. There should be a justification and clarity over it. GAG pooling is used by a fifth of trusts, surveys suggest. MATs pool all their schools funding that is issued by government, and dish out individual budgets based on their own criteria. Other trusts top slice their school budgets to fund central services. Under this method, schools get their national funding allocations and the trust instead charges a fee. On average, top-slice charges range from 5.5 per cent in the large MATs to 8.8 per cent in the smallest. This figure is usually published in annual accounts. GAG-pooling trusts said details showing central service costs are given in annual accounts, but it is difficult to deduce what proportion this accounts for in individual schools. SoSchools Weekasked 15 GAG-pooling trusts, through freedom of requests, how much funding their schools got compared with the amount awarded by the Department for Education. Ten responded with the full data. Astrea Academies Trustrebuffed our request saying releasing the would be prejudicial to the effective conduct of public affairs . Two other trusts, City Learning Trust and East Midlands Academy Trust, did not respond at all. Of those that did respond, Aspire Academy Trust retained 24 per cent of its 37 schools GAG funding in 2023-24 the highest of any trust. Eight of its schools received 28 per cent less than their government allocation, with all the others having at least 15 per cent effectively sliced. A spokesperson for the primary school-only trust said that while the pooled amounts may appear comparatively higher than others, allocations were based on need and requirements . The range and scale of services provided to schools were extensive, they said, including estates management, IT, HR, health and safety, business support and school improvement support. That left cash delegated to academies specifically for school-based staffing and curriculum- resources only . Pooling funding ensured value for money at all times and met the needs of all academies in a fair and equitable model . Some schools might also get an additional reallocation of their original GAG based on individual needs . Oasis Community Learning, one of the country s biggest trusts, took 17 per cent of its schools GAG allocations on average the second highest. It did not provide school-level figures for its 54 academies, saying this would take than 18 hours of staff time to compile, the limit for FOIs. It was followed by the Paradigm Trust in London, whose schools got 15 per cent less than allocated by the government, analysis suggests. In all, 77 schools across the 10 trusts who responded had at least 15 per cent of their budgets retained centrally. At three of the MATs Brigantia Learning Trust, Enquire Learning Trust and Our Lady of Lourdes no schools had than 10 per cent extracted. However, sector leaders say it is not possible to compare trusts based on costs alone, as each provides its schools with different services. For instance, Paradigm said it runs many central functions that would, in other trusts, be expected in each individual school budget , such as IT and SEND support, and mental health provision. Its entire school improvement team was included centrally and not recharged to individual academies. Dartmoor Multi Academy Trust retained about 12 per cent of school budgets overall last year. But as well as school improvement and financial management support, it provided schools with apprentice training, legal help and wellbeing forums. The academy trust handbook says GAG pooling enhances a MAT s ability to allocate resources in line with improvement priorities and running costs across the trust s constituent academies . Lord Agnew, the former Conservative academies minister, said it was one of the greatest academy freedoms because it helped shift funding from stronger schools to stabilise weaker schools. Tim Howes, the chief operating officer of Futura Learning Partnership, whose trust retained about 8 per cent of school budgets on average, said the MAT wanted to ensure that variances in local authority approaches to funding do not adversely impact any of our schools . It works across five council areas. It also prioritises funding to disadvantaged schools. Steve Rollett, the deputy chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, added pooling could allow trusts to target funding between schools, reserves, and shared services perhaps to cover a temporary blip in pupil numbers or to pay for a joint staff post . A report published by IMP Software last year found two thirds of GAG-pooling trusts allocated cash to their schools based on need. Just over a quarter managed all funding centrally with education budgets released for local requirements , while one in 10 used revised models to even out geographical differences . Oasis said it aimed to use 5 per cent of GAG to pay for national services or the centre . A 12 per cent was for costs that schools would have to include in their individual budgets . This led to a lower cost and higher standard than might otherwise have been able to achieve alone . We are confident that by procuring and delivering on scale we can achieve better value for money than 54 schools purchasing the same services individually, an Oasis spokesperson added. Procuring and delivering on scale means better value for money It recalculated funding using pupil numbers and deprivation levels based on government rates, rather than those set by local authorities. The only adjustments were 20,000 lump sums for one-form-entry schools and cash to support growing schools on lagged funding. The Diocese of Ely Trust, which retained about 12 per cent of its schools GAG, said that when the value of the goods and services this paid for was accounted for, the smallest schools got between 101 to 102 per cent of their ESFA income back . Among other things, it provided curriculum resources, CPD and insurance. Brigantia said than 440,000 went towards purchasing services for its schools such as IT technicians, Microsoft licences and exercise books. The trust believes that once the services it provided back to schools were accounted for, the central trust held 6 per cent. But a public accounts committee report from 2022 said the practice means there is no way to identify if every pupil in a MAT has received the government s guaranteed minimum level of funding . The practice also runs counter to the long-held aim of a national funding formula, to make funding transparent by setting out in clear blocks how cash is awarded. It is a good thing that trusts can do it, Metcalfe said. But it s very unclear how much is actually supporting very large central teams that may or may not provide value for money. Hilary Goldsmith, a school business leader, added real, genuine transparency between staff and MATs about what GAG pooling is for, why and how it leads to school improvement was needed. It s about ensuring staff fully understand the value and agree with the numbers, she said. Metcalfe said per-pupil funding allocations for each school in GAG-pooling trusts should be published on MAT websites. Rowena Hackwood, the chief executive of the Astrea Academy Trust, told a conference last month that the MAT has had to have a little bit of a think about how we develop and present that idea of what it means to have a shared, collaborative view of how we allocate our resources . She said the amounts trusts ringfenced for things such as professional services, school improvement support and estates typically comes to between 10 and 18 per cent . Scrutiny should be the price for receiving public money But she added: What we were finding was that our school leaders didn t know that was the case, and they were wondering why they couldn t get all of that stuff for 5 per cent. However, Astrea rejected our FOI request despite acknowledging the public interest in knowing how taxpayers money is used and how schools are resourced . They said available in the public domain was sufficient. Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the NEU, argued the lack of transparency around GAG pooling makes a mockery of formularisation . Scrutiny should be the price for receiving public money. But Rollett said that all trusts finances and processes were subject to rigorous external audit. E-ACT and the David Ross Education Trust also said it was not possible to say how much of the GAG funding their individual schools were accountable for, and that some of this was available publicly. Some, such as the EDSK think tank, have called for the practice to be banned. On pooling allowing trusts to smooth out funding differences, Benedicte Yue, a trust chief financial officer, also said the national funding formula was already allocating funding based on pupil characteristics . It may not be perfect, but it is transparent, and GAG-pooling arrangements could perhaps be clearly explained externally. But Dan Morrow, the chief executive of the Cornwall Education Learning Trust, said pooling funding was an inevitable structural move , with chains increasingly recognising they were one employer . This is about using every lever we have to put children first This means the notion of arbitrarily keeping funding in silos makes no organisational sense. Top-slicing relies on a static picture and is less responsive to need and the idea that you can resource where the highest need or risk is. Hackwood added: One of our greatest strengths as a trust is our ability to harness our collective power pooling resources to invest smarter, not harder. From finance to data systems, some services simply deliver better value when centralised. This is about using every lever we have to put children first. Despite this, the IMP report showed that some trusts believe pooling might discourage schools from joining especially in cases of voluntary transfers . There were also concerns about it potentially diverting attention from broader funding challenges to complaints about the trust s allocations . A report by Kreston accountants predicts pooling will continue to grow as it provided flexibility over how trusts achieve their objectives and allowed them to make quicker changes . Metcalfe added that not giving people enough financial accountability and ability to deploy staff can mean that they cannot take accountability for standards . However, Chris Kirk, of education advisory firm CJK Associates, said providing services from a trust level meant heads could focus on teaching and learning. That can be a really good thing it means that others who have professionally trained for managing estates, finance, HR can support them by focusing on those things. Schools Weekrevealed last year that the DfE was considering drawing up guidance on GAG pooling. The department said this week that it continues to consider and engage the sector to understand what support and guidance might be helpful for academy trusts, across a range of areas, including on the pooling of GAG . Rules state that trusts must consider the funding needs and allocations of each constituent school and have an appeals process that can be escalated to DfE. Its ruling would be final and could result in pooling provisions being dis-applied . In February the government said no appeals on GAG pooling had been escalated . And a former policy adviser, who did not want to be named, said: In what other world would we expect an organisation to have a single strategy, but not a single budget? That makes no sense. And those wanting red tape and checking and publishing of stuff as if schools aren t already heavily scrutinised I d ask why it s OK for a trust to spend money filling in forms, but not OK for them to spend on a challenging school serving a low income community that needs to get better? I don t know why we care about this if trusts are following the rules set out and the schools are getting better.']",Academy trust statements and responses

Education secretary Gillian Keeganhad offereda one-off 1,000 payment this academic year and a 4.3 per cent rise for most teachers next year, as well as other pledges on workload. ballot on the Government's pay offer has been rejected by an overwhelming 98 of NEU teacher members in England on a turnout of 66 . NEU2023 SaveOurSchholspic.twitter.com VERoTJ3vJW The NEUhad encouraged its members to reject the offer. It announced at its annual conference this morning that an overwhelming 98 per cent had voted to reject the deal. A total of 195,564 members voted on the pay offer a turnout of 66 per cent. Of those, 191,319 voted to reject the deal. teachers voted in the six-day survey than during the NEU s preliminary ballot for strike action which lasted four weeks. Kevin Courtney, NEU s joint general secretary, said the union was putting the education secretary on notice . Gillian we need to say to you, you are not reading the room. NEU members are telling you clearly and in ever bigger numbers, your offer does not cut the mustard. This dispute is not going away, our members are instructing us that we have to keep going for the sake of their profession and the children they teach. Courtney added that the union would write to Keegan today to inform her that the union was calling for strike action on April 27 and May 2. But Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: There is time for you to make a new offer which can resolve this dispute. We want you to make a new offer that is fully funded, which matches other rises, which begins to deal with the crisis in our schools an offer that our members would be prepared to accept. The union said it would ask districts to make local arrangements for year 11 and 13 students so they could continue to go to school during strike days. The government has said it will revert to its usual pay-setting process via the school teachers review body, which will only make recommendations for next year. Education secretary Gillian Keegan said it was extremely disappointing that the NEU have called strike action . She said negotiations had taken place in good faith and that the offer would be above both inflation and average earnings growth . The government has previously pointed to projections showing inflation is expected to fall next academic year. The NEU s decision to reject it will simply result in disruption for children and less money for teachers today. Pay will now be decided by the independent pay review body which will recommend pay rises for next year. The NEU has also announced its conference will debate an urgent motion tomorrow, calling for a three-day strike in late June or early July, and a re-ballot of members to give a mandate for walkouts next academic year. The union s previous ballot gives it a mandate for action until July this year. Another successful ballot in the summer would extend that mandate to Christmas. The motion will call on the union s executive to use the period of exams from May 15 to begin a re-ballot of teacher members in England running until the end of July . It will also call on them to timetable in a 3 day strike in late June early July to be confirmed by the executive on May 18 . The motion also proposes a national day of strike action, with a national demonstration in Manchester during the Tory Party Conference in October as part of a programme of action in the autumn term . Courtney told journalists at the conference today that the result of the ballot on the pay offer proves that we can win a re-ballot . I think government would think that we wouldn t win a re-ballot we will. We will win a re-ballot, that will take us into next year. That will take us into their election year. And we will be talking about questions of funding of children s schools, as well as pay. If you talk to MPs about 2017, when we raised funding during the general election, they re scared of that. And that might mean that they come back and offer something before then to try and avoid that prospect."", 'Unions have demanded clarity on the government s position on teacher strikes after the prime minister said his door is always open , but his education secretary rejected calls for fresh pay talks. Ministers and unions are once again locked in a stalemate over pay, after all four unions representing teachers and leaders rejected an offer of a 1,000 one-off payment this year and 4.3 per cent rise for most teachers in 2023-24. The government had warned its pay offer was final, and that it would revert to the School Teachers Review Body process as normal if it was rejected. Rishi Sunak appeared to strike a conciliatory note as he took questions at a school in north London this morning. Our door is always open, and we continue to hope that we can find a way through, he said. I think people can see actually over the past month or two that we can sit down and have reasonable and constructive conversations, he added. But just hours earlier, his education secretary Gillian Keegan rejected calls for fresh talks, saying discussions about pay would now happen via the independent pay review body . The independent pay review body is the right place to do it, and we actually said that s what would happen if they rejected this offer, she told theToday Programme. We think that s the right way to do it. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the ASCL school leaders union, said: The prime minister has said that the door is always open, but the education secretary has said on the same day that the pay process will now return to the STRB. Which is it? We strongly urge the government to reopen negotiations with a view to providing an improved settlement that will put an end to the industrial dispute and address teacher shortages. ASCL revealed over the Easter breakthat 87 per cent of voting members had rejected the pay offer, on a turnout of 56 per cent. Its executive committee will meet this week to decide next steps, including whether to move to a formal ballot , Barton said. The NAHT leaders union also rejected the offer, by 90 per cent on a turnout of 64 per cent. Its executive will meet on April 27 to discuss a potential re-ballot of members for industrial action. NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman said Sunak s comments fly in the face of the education secretary s insistence that a new offer on pay will now have to wait for the recommendation of the independent review body . Gillian Keegan previously said school leaders and teachers didn t need to strike to talk to her, but her comments appear to demonstrate that the reverse is true. Amid this chaos at the heart of government, what we can t lose sight of is that we have an education profession left in limbo and feeling demoralised and unappreciated following a decade of massive real-terms cuts to their pay and school funding, increasing workload, and a broken, high-stakes Ofsted inspection regime. The National Education Union announced earlier this month that its members will walk out again on April 27 and May 2 after 98 per cent of voting members rejected the offer, on a turnout of 66 per cent. Delegates at its conferencealso voted to timetable three strikes after the exam period this summer, and to ballot for another six-month strike mandate from July. Dr Mary Bousted, the NEU s joint general secretary, said she was heartened to hear the PM saying that his door is always open and that he hopes to find a way through to a resolution of the NEU s pay dispute . It would be helpful if Mr Sunak conveyed this message to Gillian Keegan, who said today that no new negotiations were planned with the teacher and leader unions, and that she was devolving responsibility for teacher pay to the school teacher review body. She added that the NEU had always been clear that it wishes to negotiate a resolution to the dispute . For this to happen, the government has to come up with a credible offer which addresses not only the current cost of living crisis, but also the long term decline in the relative value of teacher pay. We stand ready to walk through the door to the DfE and to recommence negotiations. The NASUWT teaching union confirmed earlier this monththat it will re-ballot members for industrial action after they voted to reject the pay deal. Its previous ballot did not meet the 50 per cent turnout threshold required. A survey of members on the offer reached a turnout of 52.4 per cent, with 87 per cent of voting members rejecting the offer. Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT s general secretary, said they had asked the secretary of state to meet again to discuss the outcome of our member consultation. Disappointingly, we are still waiting to receive a response from her. The best way to avert the prospect of industrial action is by reaching a negotiated settlement to our dispute and we remain willing to meet any time, any place anywhere. This morning, Keegan criticised the NEU for the timing of its next planned strike action. Proposed walkouts on April 27 and May 2 will take place around two weeks before GCSE and A-level tests begin, though the NEU said it would ask districts to make local arrangements for year 11 and 13 students so they could continue to go to school during strike days. Any strikes announced by the union would take place in late June at the earliest. They do not need to call strikes and they should not be calling strikes in this period up to the exam cohorts are taking exams for the first time, Keegan said today. They need their teachers there to revise, they need to make sure they can get all that catch-up if they need it, but all that security they get in that term leading up to exams. These are really big important exams and it really isn t right that they are threatening to strike or calling strikes for those days. The DfE has also added to its guidance on how schools should handle strikes to encourage leaders to consider prioritising pupils due to take public examinations andother formal assessments if restricting attendance during strikes. This includes children in KS2 who are due to take National Curriculum Assessments, or pupils due to take their GCSEs or vocational qualifications, the DfE said. Schools are encouraged to consider what action they could take to ensure pupils due totake their GCSEs or vocational qualifications are supported and prepared for theirexams . This could involve offering catch-up lessons or arranging additional revisionsessions.', 'Hundreds of thousands of teachers and school leaders will be re-balloted for strikes from today as the long-running pay dispute with the government continues. The National Education Union NEU began its ballot of around 300,000 teacher members in England this morning. It will run until July 28. Headteachers union NAHT has also opened a fresh ballot for industrial action, which will close on July 31. It comes after members of both unions rejected the government s offer on pay and working conditions for teachers and leaders. All four teaching and leadership unions are due to go to their members in the coming weeks. If the ballots pass the legal threshold, leaders have said they will coordinate strikes in the autumn term this year. Leaders have preducted such a scenario could see all state schools in England disrupted, with NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney previously claiming up to 400,000 staff could walk out. Teacher members of the NEU, the only union to have so far won a ballot, have staged several walkouts since February in a push for a bigger pay increase. But the mandate of the union scurrent ballot which saw 90.44 per cent members vote in favour of strikes ends on July 13. The NAHTannounced last monththat it would re-ballot headteachers, after its previous vote on industrial action failed to reach the turnout threshold required. Unlike the last ballot, its vote will seek a mandate for full strikes alone. Heads were previously asked if they backed strikes and action short of a strike. The NAHT s dispute with the government has also been widened to cover not just pay and funding, but also recruitment and retention, workload and wellbeing, and inspection, including its impact on headteachers mental health. Teachers unionNASUWTwill re-ballot members on pay, workload and working hours from June 5 to July 10. It also fell short of the turnout threshold last time. A vote for sixth-form college members, launched today, will run until June 12. Dates for leaders union ASCL s vote, the first formal national ballot in its history, are yet to be confirmed. With four education unions balloting members for strike action in the autumn term this should be a wake-up call, NEU joint general secretaries Dr Mary Bousted and Courtney said in a statement. Our re-ballot would allow the NEU to co-ordinate action with other teacher unions in the autumn term if government does not provgide a settlement to the dispute. It is never too late for the education secretary to come to the negotiating table and make an improved offer. Members of all four unions rejected the government s pay offer of a 1,000 one-off payment this year and a 4.3 per cent rise for most teachers from September by large margins. Unions have disputed the government s claim the offer is fully-funded. TheOffice for Statistics Regulationsaid last week that ministers had evidenced this claim in line with their own definition , but said they must bemore transparent about affordabilityfor individual schools. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of NAHT, said no meaningful talks had taken place with education secretary Gillian Keegan since members rejected the offer. Nobody working in education wants to have to go on strike, he added. But it seems this is the only way to open the government s eyes to the mess our education system is in, and the recruitment and retention crisis fuelled by years of real-terms pay and funding cuts, unsustainable workload and high-stakes inspections which harm staff wellbeing. A DfE spokesperson said it had made a pay offer to unions that was fair, reasonable, and recognised teachers hard work .']","Teacher pay, unions, and industrial action"

Eligibility for free school meals and the pupil premium, paid to schools for any child eligible for meals at any time in the last six years, are frequently used by policymakers and researchers as a proxy for disadvantage. But the think tank said in a new report that the makeup of children who receive free school meals is becoming diverse and uncertain , while at the same time the system excludes many children who live in poverty. Protections introduced by the Department for Education following the roll-out of universal credit meant children newly out of scope did not lose their eligibility until the end of their current phase of education. But the EPI said this meant some children are in the group because of protections while contemporary peers whose families have a similarly low income are not. Not knowing the basis on which children are included and flagged as FSM-eligible means the data on these pupils are less useful for research, and that policy is targeted less efficiently than is optimal. Dr Tammy Campbell, director for early years, inequalities and wellbeing at the EPI said: Free school meals has long been used as a key measure for multiple purposes within research and policymaking. Now it is time to review and improve its uses, and to look at alternatives, to better support economically disadvantaged children within the education system. The EPI found that across all years, fewer children are registered for free school meals than estimated in poverty, due to low family income thresholds at 7,400 per year. This is partly by design , because the 7,400 annual family income threshold for registration is so low . Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the NEU, said the eligibility threshold for free school meals is a disgrace . Children and schools are missing out on crucial support because of out-of-touch bureaucracy blocking children s access to food. A household income over 7,400 per year before benefits means a child is too well off to qualify. Worse still, the report shows how even those who meet the criteria are still not getting their entitlement. This has knock-on effects as schools lose out on vital pupil premium funding to support their most vulnerable children. The EPI also found gaps between poverty rates and free school meals eligibility vary by ethnicity. Among children recorded as Pakistani, Bangladeshi or Indian ethnicities, estimated poverty rates are far higher than the percentage of children registered for FSM, and, to a lesser but still large extent, for PP. This is in part because poverty estimates equivalise for family size, while FSM-eligibility does not . The EPI said the government should expand the coverage of FSM eligibility by increasing the salary threshold for families, and provide sufficient funding . Government should also consider ethnicity and language background alongside FSM and PP, for example when comparing the experiences and outcomes of FSM PP children to their peers . And the DfE should also consider centrally automatically enrolling eligible children for FSM to ensure better coverage . Auto-enrolment was also recommended by the education select committee last week. Sureena Brackenbridge, a Labour member of the committee, said she would welcome free school meals for all pupils, but accepted public finances are tight . Other pressing issues also demand funding, such as the dire state of special educational needs and disabilities provision after 14 years of neglect. A responsible government must prioritise. That said, we can still improve the free school meal system without universalising it. Auto-enrolment is also being introducedby individual councils and groups of local authorities. Ascheme run by the University of Yorklast year saw 20 councils switch to an opt-out approach, resulting in around 20,000 unregistered children being signed up for free meals. Another 40 councils are now exploring the possibility of implementing similar schemes,theGuardianreported. Pepe Di Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: All eligible children should be automatically enrolled so that no child misses out, and that schools should be paid a higher rate of pupil premium to support children who are in persistent poverty.', 'Parents set to save up to 450 per year as free breakfast club rollout targets areas where families are struggling most with the cost of living. Half a million children will benefit from Best Start free breakfast clubs from April, delivering real relief to families struggling with the rising cost of living whilst investing in the foundations of future economic growth. Applications open today for the next wave of 500 schools with 40 of pupils on free school meals to benefit from the programme, as the government invests 80 million in the right places to give every child the best start in life - recognising that a healthy, well-educated population is essential for a thriving economy. The move offers immediate help to working parents juggling childcare costs by saving them up to 450 and giving back up to 95 hours of time over two and a half working weeks each year. That s money back in pockets and time back in busy lives, helping families with the cost of living whilst ensuring children are ready to learn and succeed. The government has increased the per child funding rate for mainstream schools to 1, making good on its commitment to roll out clubs with a variety of healthy meals. Schools will also receive a guaranteed 25 a day to cover staffing and admin so every type of school can easily deliver a breakfast club. For an average school with 50 take up, the total funding package has increased by 28 . The tough decisions we ve made to stabilise the economy have enabled us to invest in our public services, including free breakfast clubs, and the Budget will deliver on our plan for national renewal by boosting opportunity for all. Today s announcement builds on the government s decisions to prioritise investment to help families with the cost of living such as expanding free school meals to every family on Universal Credit, which will lift 100,000 children out of poverty, capping branded school uniform , and introducing 30 hours funded childcare to working parents, saving them up to 7,500 per year. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: I grew up in a family where every bill mattered, and I know what it feels like for parents trying to make ends meet. That s why helping families with the cost of living is my number one priority. Free breakfast clubs are already a lifeline for parents, and now we re going to deliver on that promise beginning the national rollout. Not only that, but we re prioritising those communities feeling the sharpest squeeze, tackling both the cost of living and child poverty head-on. This isn t just about saving parents money and time; it s about investing in the next generation to give them the best start in life. Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson said: This is national renewal in action - breaking down barriers so every child gets the best start in life, regardless of their background. By rolling out free breakfast clubs to half a million children, we re not just filling empty stomachs, we re supercharging the nation s morning routines. This is about building a country where background doesn t mean destiny, where we invest in our children s futures, and where we deliver the real change working families desperately need. By prioritising schools with the highest proportion of pupils on free school meals the rollout ensures the real-life impact of free breakfast clubs goes first to where it is most needed, helping to invest in the country s economic future. Evidence gathered through the test and learn phase shows than one in three parents 38 find it difficult to give their child a healthy breakfast before school, with fussy eating 36 and time 28 being the main barriers. As a crucial part of the Plan for Change, a 1,500 primary schools will start offering the free clubs in September 2026, with applications due to open in January, altogether helping to extend benefits to over 200,000 underprivileged children in a little over a year of the programme launching. Changing morning routines will not only help ensure no child starts the day hungry but boost attendance, attainment and future life chances. With 5 million free breakfasts already served, the clubs are already helping ensure a child s background will never be a barrier to opportunity. Among children aged 5-7, breakfast clubs have been proven to boost average attainment by the equivalent of 2 months progress in maths, reading and writing. Better educational outcomes mean better job prospects, higher earnings and a stronger economy - demonstrating how investing in public services today drives economic growth tomorrow. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said: Our free breakfast clubs are ensuring over half a million children don t start the school day hungry, and save working parents around 450 a year. We re launching this in the parts of the country that need it most helping to bring bills down for families across Britain. But we know there s to do, which is why at my Budget I ll make the fair decisions to cut NHS waiting lists, cut national debt and cut the cost of living. By saving even parents up to 450 per year, money is going back into communities so they can choose how to spend it. The targeted approach drives security, respect and opportunity back into society so families and kids can get on in life. This follows the test and learn phase that successfully delivered 750 clubs up and down the country, helping to provide a soft supportive start to children and a lifeline to working parents. In a landmark move to go even , the government s pro-business approach has secured new industry partnerships with Morrisons, Sainsbury s and Weetabix as well as Magic Breakfast for current early adopter schools until July 2026. This will ensure top British brands can help schools benefit from discounts and free deliveries and kids to have access to healthier, varied meals. Duncan Jacques, Chief Executive Officer of Exceed Academies Trust said: Free breakfast clubs have made a real difference for children and families at Exceed Academies Trust, with over a hundred children attending daily. They help our children start the day settled and ready to learn and we ve seen improvements in attendance and punctuality. Following a nutritious breakfast children are able to focus on their schoolwork and are keen to succeed. Following the success of the test and learn phase, the programme is now rolling out nationally. Increasing the funding rate will ensure trusts like ours keep offering this valuable support and the clubs remain of high quality. It comes ahead of the upcoming Child Poverty Strategy, where every lever to employment, housing, children s health, childcare and education will be examined to improve children s life chances. DfE media enquiries Central newsdesk - for journalists 020 7783 8300', 'All children from households eligible for universal credit will be offered free school meals in what the prime minister has hailed as a historic moment . But schools will not receive additional pupil premium funding for the children who become eligible for free lunches as part of the expansion. TheDepartment for Educationestimates over 500,000 pupils will be eligible for free school meals under the expansion, and claims it will lift 100,000 children out of poverty. At present, only families with a household income below 7,400 can claim free lunches. Education charities and unions have long called for an extension of the scheme, as at present even some children in poverty lose out. But ministers have not said where the funding is coming from for the expansion, which will come into force from 2026. However, the government is expected to make a large saving as a mechanism put in place to stop pupils losing free meals eligibility during the universal rollout ends next year. This may also mean a much smaller net rise in the numbers eligible for free lunches. Prime minister Sir Keir Starmer said: Feeding children every day, for free, is one of the biggest interventions we can make to put money in parents pockets, tackle the stain of poverty, and set children up to learn. This expansion is a truly historic moment for our country. The DfE said it expected the majority of schools will allow parents to apply before the start of the school year 2026, by providing their national insurance number to check their eligibility . School food campaigner Andy Jolley said the extension was a really positive move by education secretary Bridget Philipson that will help many families out of poverty. But he warned it was a missed opportunity to introduce auto-enrolment. There is a risk some families will fall through the gap and not register, whilst schools will be concerned there is a new expectation on them to process parents national insurance details. And government has confirmed schools and councils will only get pupil premium and home to school transport extended rights funding based on the existing free school meals threshold. It means those pupils becoming eligible under the expansion next year will not attract the funding of up to 1,480 a year. Pupil premium cash is paid to schools for every pupil who has been eligible for free school meals at any point in the previous six years. Dr Tammy Campbell, of the Education Policy Institute, said there did not appear to be a clear rationale from government as to why the new free school meal eligibility criteria will not be reflected in pupil premium eligibility. The government is clear that these children are growing up in difficult circumstances. As such they are likely to have lower attainment and benefit from additional support in school. Russell Hobby, CEO of Teach First, said without the extra pupil premium funding, schools miss out on essential resources that could support pupils academic progress and wellbeing . Carl Cullinane, director of research and policy at the Sutton Trust, said in an ideal world these pupils would also become eligible for pupil premium funding, to allow schools to provide them with wider educational support. However we are sensitive to the tough financial realities currently facing the government. Ultimately, feeding children from homes that are eligible for Universal Credit, and are therefore the most likely to suffer from food poverty, is the right thing to do. The government has not said how much it expects the FSM expansion to cost. Based on the current funding rate of 490 a year, feeding 500,000 pupils would cost 254 million. But the Treasury is expected to make a big saving when transitional protections introduced when universal credit was rolled out come to an end. The arrangements have meant that since 2018, any pupil that would have lost their eligibility because their household breached the 7,400 earnings threshold has kept receiving meals until the end of their current school phase. The protections have already been extended several times and were due to end this year, but the government announced today they have extended them again until 2026. We will then end protections altogether, meaning FSM funding is focused on pupils in families in receipt of UC who most need it, the DfE said. Campbell welcomed the expansion of free school meals, but warned the DfE has not fully assessed the number of children who will cease to be eligible for FSM as a result of the conclusion of transitional protections. It is possible that the extension of eligibility will largely serve to balance out the cessation of transitional protections, rather than making significant numbers of children newly eligible. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that in the long-term, the extension would cost around 1 billion and benefit 1.7 million children, and would see around 100,000 children lifted out of poverty . But in the short run, both the costs and the benefits of this policy are likely to be much smaller because of the transitional protections. The ultimate impact of these transitional protections is that many children are currently receiving free school meals than would otherwise be the case, the think tank said. The government s prediction that around 500,000 will benefit implies a total short-run cost of 250 million . This is less than a third of the long-run cost and impact of this policy. But it also means that today s announcement will not see anything like 100,000 children lifted out of poverty next year . The announcement, ahead of next week s spending review, follows reports the government s wider child poverty strategy has been postponed until at least the autumn. Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, called the FSM extension a a downpayment on our child poverty strategy . No date has been set for its release. The government has also confirmed today that it is revising the school food standards,as reported bySchools Weeklast year.']",Free school meals and breakfast provision

The Department for Education this week finally published guidance on the way it will distribute cash through the national funding formula in 2025-26, along with notional allocations for schools. Chancellor Rachel Reevesannounced 2.3 billion extra funding at the budget in October, but 1 billion was for high needs. Today s guidancestates that per-pupil funding will increase by 2.23 per cent on average, but that this includes a 1.28 per cent increase to fund the impact next year of this September s 5.5 per cent pay rise. The impact of the rise from September to next March was covered by a separate grant, but this will be rolled into the national funding formula from next year. Luke Sibieta, research fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said schools would need to cover the full year cost of the September 2024 teacher pay award and any staff pay awards in 2025 . On the basis of existing policy and forecasts for average earnings, we estimate that schools cost will grow by than 3 per cent next year. On that basis, most schools might struggle to break even next year unless they can find savings somewhere. Julia Harnden, funding specialist at the ASCL leaders union, said the inclusion of the pay rise cash means that the net per pupil increase next year is less than 1 per cent, which is unlikely to be sufficient to meet the rising costs of schools as these costs tend to outstrip inflation. In particular, it is difficult to see how schools will be able to afford teacher and support staff pay awards at anything like the level required. A DfE survey of schools in summer 2023, published Thursday, found just 4 per cent felt financially secure. Two in five reported financial pressure which requires substantial changes to spend profiles and provision , including cuts to classroom support and curriculum resources. Most schools projected spending on energy costs and on teaching and teaching support. Spend areas most likely to be cut included continuing professional development and ICT. This week s funding guidance also revealed the government has lowered what is called the funding floor a mechanism which seeks to limit the impact of annual changes in funding on school budgets. In previous years, the national funding formula included a funding floor of 0.5 per cent, which was meant to guarantee every school an increase of per-pupil funding of at least that amount, compared to a baseline of the funding they received the year before. The guidance states that the funding floor for 2025-26 has been set at a lower level of 0 per cent. However, the department said the baseline for the current financial year also includes a uplift to ensure that the 2024 teacher pay award remains fully funded in 2025 to 2026 at a national level . Because of this baseline uplift, the 0 per cent floor in 2025 to 2026 still incorporates a year-on-year increase in funding compared to what schools attracted in 2024 to 2025. Jon Andrews, head of analysis at the Education Policy Institute, said comparing this year s NFF allocations to last is made complicated by the rolling in of various grants into the NFF itself . School baselines have been recalculated to include these additional grants, and uplifted to reflect the fact that these grants did not cover the full financial year.', 'The chancellor has set out government spending plans for the next three years, boosting the schools budget, extending the rebuilding programme and increasing Ofsted s funding. But the school funding increase will only amount to a roughly 1 per cent average real-terms increase to per-pupil funding each year our news story on that here . It also has to cover cash for SEND reforms, the free school meals expansion and next year s pay award. Here s what you need to know. Documents confirm the core schools budget will increase from 64.8 billion this year to 69.5 billion in 2028, a cash-terms increase of 4.7 billion by the end of the spending review period. However, this includes the 410 million annual cost of the recently announced extension of free school meals, and the 615 million allocated earlier in the spring to contribute to next year s 4 per cent teacher pay rise. Some of it will also go towards SEND reforms see point 2 below . Once schools rising costs are taken into account, the injection works out as a 1.1 per cent average annual real-terms increase over the spending review. However, if you exclude the free school meals cash, which is effectively already ringfenced, the average annual per-pupil funding rise will be 0.9 per cent in real terms. When looking at the schools budget overall, the rise equates to just 0.4 per cent in real-terms over the spending review period. And once the free school meals expansion cash is excluded, you get a real-terms freeze in the budget , said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies. However, pupil numbers overall are now falling, which would in principle allow a rise in spending per pupil , he added. The government has also described the rise in funding as a 2 billion real-terms increase, but this is using 2023-24, the year before the election, as a baseline, so is misleading. Unions have welcomed the small increase, but said schools will still face difficult decisions in the short term. The Treasury documents also state that the government has set aside 760 million for reform of the SEND system , with most of this falling in the 2026-27 year. This comes from the 3.25 billion public services transformation fund . However, the DfEconfirmed to Schools Week that this money is part of the increase in the core schools budget. This, alongside the continued rise in the number of pupils with special needs, could actually mean the best schools could hope for is a real-terms freeze in mainstream school funding per pupil , Luke Sibieta, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said. It is also expected that the government will need to provide funding for its SEND reforms, with councils pushing for high-needs deficits to be wiped. The DfE has said the 760 million is just one part of the investment government will make in SEND reform, not the entirety . The government will set out its SEND reform plans in a schools white paper, to be published in the autumn. The reforms will make the system inclusive and improve outcomes for all children and young people , the documents claimed. The government will also set out details on supporting local authorities as the government transitions to a reformed system as part of the upcoming local government funding reform consultation, the Treasury added. But Schools Week also understands that the white paper will be broader than just SEND, and include wider school reforms. The government has already committed to ramping up the school rebuilding programme, which was slow in its first few years. Spending this year was due to be around 1.4 billion. Today s documents show government expects to spend around 2.4 billion per year for the programme over the spending review period. When the SRP was announced in 2021, it was due to be a 10-year programme to rebuild around 500 schools. The government said today that as part of its 10 year infrastructure strategy, it will also commit to expand the programme, providing long-term certainty out to 2034-35 . However, it has not said how many schools will now be targeted. Spending on school maintenance and repairs will also rise by around 400 million to around 2.3 billion a year by 2029-30. However, the document said this rise was only in line with inflation . Meanwhile, around 2.6 billion will be spent from 2026 27 to 2029-30 to fund provision of mainstream school places needed to meet future demographic needs . In 2021, thespending review allocated the same amount of money for new provision which was focused on places for children with SEND. Sibieta said the increase in school capital spending overall equated to a 7 per cent real-terms increase, which reversed real-terms cuts since 2015. Despite reports Ofsted was unlikely to secure cash at the spending review, documents show its budget will rise from just under 140 million in 2025-26, to nearly 159.4 million in 2026-27. This will fund the inspectorate to support the government s mission to break down barriers to opportunity, including developing and implementing multi-academy trust inspections to increase accountability of MAT leaders , the Treasury documents stated. It s not clear exactly how much extra this is, as Ofsted s budget was actually 148 million in 2024-25, and will also fall back down to 153 million in 2028-29. No details have been provided on what the cash will go towards. But Lynsey Holzer, CEO of The Active Learning Trust, said the choice of funding of projects doesn t feel like it hangs together in terms of a well understood strategy from the government . She said it would seem interesting timing, since we still don t have clarity on the new schedule for school inspections, so funding a second stream may be a moot point Labour has pledged to recruit an additional 6,500 specialist teachers to shortage subjects by the end of this Parliament, and recently confirmed this would not include primary teachers. The DfE s permanent secretary Susan Acland-Hood recently told an education committee fine detail of the policy would only be announced following the spending review. But the documents mention the pledge only once, stating that the settlement for schools and colleges supports the government s commitment to recruit 6,500 teachers over the course of this Parliament across secondary schools, education settings and specialist schools . The government has also confirmed it has allocated 370 million across four years to deliver school-based nurseries in spare primary classrooms. The DfE previously announced 37 million for the first tranche of projects. Ministers have also allocated 132.5 million of dormant assets to invest in school libraries and facilities to support disadvantaged young people to access music, sport, and drama . Overall, the DfE s total budget will increase to 109.2 billion by 2028, equivalent to an annual average real terms increase of 1.5 per cent , the documents show. That 1.5 per cent rise puts the DfE behind most other areas of spending. For example, spending on energy security and net zero is rising by 16 per cent, the law officers departments are getting a 6.2 per cent boost and business and trade is getting 5.8 per cent. However, it s worth pointing out the DfE has a much larger overall budget than many other government departments. Just looking at cash amounts, education got the fourth highest increase of all departments. But, according to the Treasury documents, the DfE s administration budget will drop by 15 per cent over the spending review period to 490 million.', 'The government pledged extra cash for schools and SEND at last week s budget. Now the dust has settled, here s what we know The chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the core schools budget would increase by 2.3 billion next year. However, 1 billion is specifically for high-needs. The Institute for Fiscal Studies IFS has saidthe increase represents a 1.4 per cent real-terms increase in total spending, or 1.6 per cent in spending per pupil. Luke Sibieta, an IFS research fellow, said the growth in core school spending would lift spending per pupil, after adjusting for inflation, to about 8,100 just above its high point of 8,000 in 2010 . The Conservatives promised for years that funding rises would restore budgets to 2010 levels in real terms, but inflation and cost rises kept setting the pledge back. The government has also said the 1.3 billion would continue to fully fund this summer s 5.5 per cent pay award for teachers, and help cover pay awards in 2025-26 . This was expected. When the government accepted the pay rise in July it said that it would provide almost 1.2 billion in the current financial year before rolling the funding into the national funding formula from next year. But the mention of next year s pay rises raises the prospect that the 2025 pay award will not attract full additional funding. The Department for Education also said that despite the investment, there will still be difficult decisions to take on how money is spent right across the public sector including in schools . Education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the extra 1 billion in SEND funding would go directly to providing provision and represented a 6 per cent real-terms increase. But this contradicts the Treasury, which said in budget documents that it expected 865 million of the pot would go on reducing councils huge SEND deficits. Treasury documents stated councils would have discretion on how they spent the additional cash, but predicted it is very likely that they will use the funding to reduce their in-year deficit . A damning report by the National Audit Officelast monthrevealedthe DfEpredicted a cumulative deficit on councils high-needs funding budgets of about 4.6 billion by March 2026. The cash was an important step to return the system to financial sustainability , the Treasury said. It would be built on through phase two of the spending review next spring. National funding formula allocations will be published at the end of this month. The government will raise employers NI contributions by 1.2 percentage points to 15 per cent from April, an increase the National Foundation for Educational Research has estimated icould cost schools hundreds of millions of pounds. The Treasury has said government departments would get funding to compensate public sector organisations, but the amount will not be confirmed until spring. When Phillipson was asked whether schools and colleges would be fully compensated for the rise, she said they will be compensated at a national level . The wording here is important, because there are often winners and losers when funding is distributed to schools, so there is still no guarantee each school will receive all the funding needed. In the past, the share of cash given to schools with smaller teacher-to-pupil ratios such as special schools and alternative provision has been way below what they need. It wasn t all good news. The DfE will have to save 1.9 billion as part of a government cost-cutting drive. Reeves said all departments will have a 2 per cent productivity, efficiency, and savings target from next year. The DfE said this week it was always looking at how it could use its funding as efficiently as possible to deliver best value for children. It pointed to savings through the review of the free schools programme and scrapping the Conservative s plans for an Advanced British Standard. It has already wielded the axe to fill a potential 1.5 billion budget black holeto fund teacher pay rises in previous years. Cuts include development courses, teacher top-up training and governor recruitment schemes. Phillipson also urged schools to use their money efficiently, wherever possible as there would be tough decisions to take on how money is spent across the public sector. Labour s free breakfast clubs for primary pupils may not be rolled out nationwide until April 2026 at the earliest. The 30 million set aside for the clubs will include money for an early adopter scheme, with 750 primaries taking part for a year from April 2025. It suggests a national roll out pledged in the party s manifesto will come the following year at the earliest. The DfE said it would share timings of national rollout in due course. The new funding also covers the extension of the existing national school breakfast club programme into 2025-26. The scheme, aimed at schools in the poorest areas, was due to end next July, prompting concerns it would create a cliff edge of support for secondary schools which Labour s scheme does not cover. Schools in disadvantaged areas are eligible if they have 40 per cent or pupils in bands A-F of the income deprivation affecting children index. The scheme is used by about 2,700 schools. Reeves announced last week that she would hand the DfE 6.7 million in capital funding next year, a 19 per cent real-terms increase on this year. However, documents show this year is a low bar with capital funding falling from 6.2 billion in 2023-24 to 5.5 billion. And high inflation in the construction industry has meant initial estimates have slipped. The new money includes 1.4 billion to fund the school rebuilding programme in the 2025-26 financial year, up 550 million on the spend this year. But it will not fund any new projects. The government has not said whether the programme overall would be expanded beyond the roughly 500 projects already announced. Nor has it said what funding would look like in the future. The capital funding also includes 2.1 billion to improve the condition of the school estate , up 300 million compared with this year. However, officials have said that the new government is reviewing its systems for allocating maintenance cash such as the condition improvement fund and school capital allocations. The government predicts 35,000 private school pupils will move into state schools as a result of the VAT policy change, costing about 300 million after several years. VAT will be charged on fees from January and the schools will have to pay business rates from April. The government said this week it expected about 3,000 pupils to move before the end of the 2024-25 academic year and that 35,000 would move in the long-term with revenue costs to peak at 300 million after several years . The policy is expected to earn about 1.8 billion which the government said is expected to have a very significant positive net impact on the exchequer . However, ministers are now facing legal action from the Independent Schools Council, an umbrella body for seven associations representing such schools. The council said its case would centre around alleged breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights ECHR and Human Rights Act 1998.']",School funding and education budgets

Hello I m sorry I can t be with you today as planned. I hope you ve had a brilliant couple of days discussing every aspect of apprenticeships delivery. I want to say thank you to Shane Mann and FE Week for organising this conference. I always say that FE Week makes the life of a Skills Minister difficult - but it makes complacency impossible! Whenever I want to find out what s going on in the DfE, I FE Week. My whole political life has been about championing apprenticeships and skills. I ve done this because I ve seen the good they can do in my own constituency. They are the greatest tool we have for advancing social justice. A range of complementary training options, from Level 2 to degree level, will allow people of all backgrounds to climb the Ladder of Opportunity - gaining the skills they need to improve their income and their future. Recently I took a journey from West to East, from St Austell to Ipswich. The Proclaimers may have walked 500 miles, but I covered 843 over the course of National Apprenticeship Week. I met apprentices, employers and training providers who were full of enthusiasm for the programme, keen to demonstrate their skills and teaching. They really want skills education and industry to succeed in this country. importantly, they are putting in the hard yards to make it happen. The government s reforms and investment have seen a transformation of the skills landscape. This has already brought about incredible dividends. There are now nearly 690 apprenticeship standards - each one designed by employers with IfATE to teach the skills that employees really need. While a lot has been achieved - with the help of many here today - there is still much to do. My 3 goals I d like to discuss today are: Building an Apprenticeships Nation Building an Apprenticeships Nation Prioritising quality over quantity, and Prioritising quality over quantity, and Making sure apprenticeships serve social justice, by bringing opportunities to those who need them most. Making sure apprenticeships serve social justice, by bringing opportunities to those who need them most. Building an Apprenticeships Nation means integrating apprenticeships into the way that everyone sees work, study and recruitment. They are not a minority pursuit for people who didn t choose university, or just a pathway dedicated to ancient, guilded trades though they re great for those too! They are about spreading opportunities to enter every trade possible, in away that allows the employer to specify your training. Currently nearly 70 of occupations can now be entered via an apprenticeship and we intend to build on this! Apprenticeships should be part of the conversation at every Sixth Form careers fair, and whenever businesses seek to hire specific skills. To build an Apprenticeships Nation, these qualifications needed to be fully and intelligently financed. We met this challenge by asking the employers with the deepest pockets to contribute to high quality training. The Apprenticeship Levy came into effect in 2017; it has allowed us to double apprenticeships spending in cash terms, from 1.2 billion in 2010-11 to 2.5 billion in 2022-23. To keep pace with the cost of living last year, IfATE awarded funding uplifts to almost 80 apprenticeship standards, by an average of 35 . And to ensure apprentices gain vital skills, we recently increased the apprenticeship funding rate for English and maths tuition by 54 . In 2024-25, we will spend 2.7 billion on high-quality apprenticeships. I m passionate about the Apprenticeship Levy, and not just because of the money it brings in! Putting a statutory obligation on big companies to contribute to the programme has really helped shift the culture in how apprenticeships are perceived and who offers them. It s why I don t agree with calls to spend the Levy on other skills training. Fewer apprentices would be employed, with people doing shorter qualifications of varying quality. Using half of Levy funds in this way could have resulted in around 60 fewer apprentice starts last academic year. I m determined that it will remain the Ronseal Levy that does what it says on the tin: supports employers to take-on apprentices and invest in the high quality training needed for a skilled workforce. An Apprenticeships Nation means extending this training up to degree level, at the best universities. Degree apprenticeships are so important because of their unique offer. Students benefit from brilliant collaborations between top businesses and world-class universities which fit them for a great career, pay them a wage, and don t charge tuition fees. This is particularly valuable to people from disadvantaged backgrounds. A degree apprenticeship can act as a launchpad to a highly-paid job for someone without any background in that industry. Level 6 apprentices have median earnings of over 34,500 once they complete - demonstrating just how valuable these workers are to employers. Over 222,000 people have started on these prestigious training pathways since 2015. That s remarkable - but I m determined that these opportunities reach many, many people. It s why we ve made up to 40 million available for universities to expand degree-level apprenticeships. But to really build an Apprenticeships Nation, we must continue our revolution in careers provision. School pupils should have awareness of apprenticeships, and where they can take you, well before their tertiary choices at 16. That is why we strengthened the provider access legislation, known as the Baker Clause, via the Skills and Post-16 Education Act in 2022. We now stipulate that every school must provide pupils with a minimum of six education and training provider encounters, to build their understanding of what technical routes can offer. I am determined that students have opportunities to see industries and occupations up close, and to learn about the benefits of technical routes and skills education. Over 95 of schools and colleges are now part of The Careers Enterprise Company s network of Careers Hubs, working with almost 400 major employers. Our ASK programme is raising older pupils awareness of the benefits of apprenticeships and T Levels. It had 625,000 interactions with young people in over 2,400 schools in 2022 23. I ve met with Sir Martyn Oliver since his appointment as the Chief Inspector of Ofsted, and he is fully onboard with this vital aspect of skills reform that careers education fully educate pupils on all their options. My next goal for apprenticeships is quality over quantity. There is no point wracking-up huge numbers of participants if the training people receive is not second to none. To raise the prestige of vocational, technical education, we must ensure that these employer-led qualifications are to the highest standard. If you compare pre-2010 apprenticeships with 2024 apprenticeships, you re not comparing apples and pears. You re comparing apples with tortoises. There were fewer than half a million people participating in apprenticeships in 2009 10. Those training programmes had no requirement to last at least a year, and no minimum guided learning hours. Last year over 750,000 were participating and training to the rigorous, industry-designed standards we introduced from 2014. I know participation has fluctuated over the last decade, as high quality standards and the Levy were introduced. But quality matters than quantity because it serves everyone in the long term businesses, the economy and learners outcomes. Quality will help us to achieve our ambition of reaching a 67 achievement rate for apprenticeship by 2025. Government is sometimes accused of not thinking about the long term. I m glad we did 10 years ago, at about the same time as the first Annual Apprenticeship Conference was being organised. Now, although I prioritise quality over quantity, quantity comes a close second. This academic year we ve already seen over 160,000 apprenticeship starts, up 3 on the same period the previous year. Among those, the number of young people under 19 starting an apprenticeship is up by 6 , to over 50,000 starts. Overall, 65 of these starts are at Levels 2 3 the crucial point at which young people may finish their education. An apprenticeship allows them to build to higher levels later if they chose. There have been nearly 27,000 apprenticeship starts at degree level in the first quarter, up 4 on same period last year. And the number of achievements is up 22 so far this academic year, with 37,400 people passing their apprenticeship. But that s not enough! It won t surprise you to hear I want as many people as possible to do apprenticeships. My final goal for apprenticeships is that they serve social justice. This is a core part of my personal mission in politics, and why I have such enthusiasm for this training. It is not fair that opportunities to enter good work, with progression and a rising pay scale are often not given to those who need them most. Apprenticeships provide a Ladder of Opportunity for people to climb to a better life - that s why I champion them. I m keen that we present apprenticeships to all kinds of candidates as an attractive, supported option. This includes young people who ve spent time in care, and haven t enjoyed a stable family life to guide decisions about their future. In August we raised the bursary for care-experienced apprentices to 3,000. These young people can now begin their training confident they can cover the living costs usually met by family. This is on top of the 1,000 available to both the employer and training provider who take on a care-experienced apprentice. It s total of 5,000 additional funding for each young person who s spent time in care, which will boost these apprentices outcomes. We know there are specific challenges to hiring younger apprentices, and those with health and learning conditions. That s why we also provide an additional 1,000 of funding to employers and training providers who hire apprentices aged 19-24 with an Education, Health and Care Plan. The same subsidy is also available for hiring younger apprentices aged 16 to 18. And to assist hiring candidates with an EHC plan, we have recently lowered the English and Maths requirements to entry level 3 for these apprentices. I also want to explore how we can help disabled people to progress and complete their apprenticeship. That s why we ve begun a pilot scheme to help training providers offer quality mentoring to these individuals. It will give participants tailored support from someone who understands the apprenticeship programme, as well as their individual needs and circumstances. Social justice means making sure apprenticeships are offered as a choice to everyone who could benefit from them - particularly those unlikely to apply unless encouraged by their school or college. We set lofty goals when we began reforming the apprenticeships programme 10 years ago. I m determined that we continue to set our sights high, to make apprenticeships better and better throughout the 2020s and 2030s. I have a picture in my office of John F Kennedy - the 35th President of the United States. Back in the 1960s, he also had high ambitions. He said: We choose to go to the Moon and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. His point was that s what makes it worthwhile! We could spend less money and time and effort, but we wouldn t have a space programme - or an apprenticeships programme - to be proud of. I know this because I ve been campaigning for these reforms for a long time. We re doing it not because it s easy, but because it s hard. We know that every apprenticeship undertaken, and every apprenticeship taken-on, means better prospects and security for the apprentice, and better business outcomes for the employer. Let me leave you with that high-flying thought. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy today s conference. Updates to this Explore the topic Education, training and skills"", 'Shorter and flexible apprenticeships and new English and maths requirements to boost skills and support employers . Up to 10,000 apprentices will be able to qualify per year as the government cuts red tape to boost economic growth bygiving employers flexibility over maths and English requirements. Rules slowing down the training of workers in key industries like construction will also be changed as the government reveals plans to turbocharge growth industries with reduced bureaucracy for apprenticeships and new leadership also appointed forSkills England. Leading employers have been calling for these changes. Businesses will now be able to decide whether adult learners over the age of 19 when they start their apprenticeship course will need to complete a level 2 English and maths qualification equivalent to GCSE in order to pass it. This means learners can qualify in high-demand sectors such as healthcare, social care and construction, helping to drive growth and meet government targets in key areas such as housebuilding. This could mean as many as 10,000 apprentices per year will be able to complete their apprenticeship, unlocking opportunity in communities all over the country and breaking the link between background and success. It does not mean that apprentices won t be assessed on core English and maths skills relevant to their occupation, but it does mean that apprentices will be able to focus on their paid work. The minimum duration of an apprenticeship will be reduced to 8 months, down from the current minimum of 12 months. Secretary of State for Education Bridget Phillipson said: Growing the economy and opportunity for all are fundamentalmissions of our Plan for Change, and we are determined to support apprentices throughout this National Apprenticeship Week and beyond. Businesses have been calling out for change to the apprenticeship system and these reforms show that we are listening. Our new offer of shorter apprenticeships and less red tape strikes the right balance between speed and quality, helping achieve our number one mission to grow the economy. Skills England will be a major driver in addressing the skills gaps needed to support employers up and down the country and I look forward to working with the new leadership. Craig Beaumont, Executive Director, Federation of Small Businesses, said: It s encouraging to see government shorten the length of apprenticeships, and give employers the right to decide whether Level 2 English and maths is needed. These flexibilities should helpSMEemployers fill skills gaps faster. These announcements come as the Education Secretary kicked off National Apprenticeship Week yesterday, which celebrates the achievements of apprentices around the country and the positive impact they make to communities, businesses, and the wider economy. The plans also follow the Prime Minister s announcement in September, when he pledged to reform the new growth and skills offer to ensure young people are better supported. Three trailblazer apprenticeships in key shortage occupations will look to pioneer the new shorter apprenticeship approach, with apprentices in green energy, healthcare and film and TV production set to be able to take on these new courses. Changes to the minimum length of an apprenticeship will be introduced from August 2025 subject to the legislative timetable, with changes to English and maths requirements coming into effect immediately. This will be hugely beneficial to employers in sectors like construction, which have an urgent need for qualified workers, helping to meet the government s mission to build 1.5 million homes by the end of this Parliament. The Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has also announced that Phil SmithCBEwill chair Skills England, the new nationwide body for skills, with Sir David Bell serving as Vice Chair. Tessa Griffiths and Sarah Maclean will jointly serve asCEO, while Gemma Marsh will serve as DeputyCEO. Phil Smith is the former chair andCEOof international tech and telecoms giant Cisco. He brings extensive industry experience in digital, tech and innovation leadership and his appointment signals the seriousness of the government s plan for growth, unlocked via a national vision for skills. Sir David Bell has 4 decades of experience in the education and skills sector and is currently Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of the University of Sunderland . Phil SmithCBEsaid: I know from my time in industry how valuable direct engagement from employers can be in shaping government policy. We need a dynamic skills system that can drive economic growth, and I m excited to be involved in shaping Skills England as part of that. Sir David Bell said: I look forward to working with Phil Smith, other colleagues in Skills England, and the Department for Education to help deliver economic growth and meet the nation s skills needs. I know from my experience in public policy and higher education that providing the skilled workforce which Britain requires depends on industry, government and education organisations working together. I am very confident therefore that Skills England will provide the strategic oversight to make that happen. Skills England will bring together key partners to meet the skills needs of the next decade across all regions of England. than 700 stakeholders have already been engaged through roundtables, webinars and engagement events. It will work with employers; national, regional and local government; providers; and unions to identify skills shortages and provide strong strategic direction for the skills system. One of Skills England s first orders of business will be to identify which apprenticeships would be best served by the shorter duration approach. Skills England will prioritise key shortage occupations as per the industrial strategy, helping to boost growth under our Plan for Change. Euan BlairMBE, founder andCEO, Multiverse, said: This important announcement will do so much to widen and expand access to apprenticeships and should be welcomed as a move to put our skills system at the heart of the growth mission. For years, this requirement has created an artificial barrier between apprenticeships and those who could benefit from them, including young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and older workers whose roles are at risk of job displacement, while often diluting the quality and purpose of an apprenticeship. Apprenticeships are about giving as many people as possible the ability to improve their career prospects and contribute meaningfully to their employers. This move helps to underline that focus. Sharon Blyfield, Head of Early Careers, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners GB, said: At Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, we believe that the inclusion of functional skills as an exit for apprenticeships have often hindered many people from reaching their full potential. The announced changes will help make apprenticeships a viable option to people, not only new recruits but also for our current employees who missed out on these skills during their school years. These changes will enable them to successfully complete their apprenticeships without added barriers, which is brilliant news. Alex Hall-Chen, Principal Policy Advisor, Sustainability, Skills and Employment, said: Apprenticeships are a vital tool in tackling the UK s persistent skills shortages, and this announcement is a welcome step in removing unnecessary barriers to increasing apprenticeship numbers. Research withIoDmembers clearly showed that giving employers flexibility when it comes to English and maths qualifications for adult apprentices has the potential to unlock apprenticeship opportunities. Employers are well placed to judge whether English and maths qualifications are the most appropriate route to evidence or develop the literacy and numeracy skills needed for success in the given career path. Chris Bailey, Early Careers Manager, Starbucks UK, said: Starbucks UK welcomes the announcement around relaxing the requirements of functional skills for learners over the age of 19 . Removing this significant barrier will support our commitment to enrolling apprentices, particularly those who may have previously faced challenges with functional skills assessments. By embracing this change, we can empower of our partners to gain valuable recognised qualifications, develop their skills, and progress within Starbucks and their careers. Lisa Pinfield, Group Director of Performance and Development, Capita, said: Making functional skills requirements flexible for apprenticeships will open doors for adult learners, especially those from diverse backgrounds. By removing unnecessary barriers, employers can welcome a wider pool of talented apprentices who bring valuable skills and experience. This change will help businesses grow, support social mobility, and give people the chance to succeed through apprenticeships. Jo Rackham, Executive Director of People, the John Lewis Partnership, said: Apprenticeships help us build and retain the skills we need to deliver brilliant service to our customers and power our growth. They ve helped 5,000 employees or, as we re called, partners progress in their careers since 2017. We welcome the relaxation in functional skills requirements. It s an important step towards the reform needed to help people access apprenticeships. Gaining GCSE maths and English qualifications can be a significant barrier to starting or completing one and we believe it will help disadvantaged people, including those who leave the care system or those with learning disabilities, make a career for themselves. Matthew Percival, Future of Work and Skills Director, CBI, said: Apprenticeships have an important role to play in building the skills for growth. Greater flexibility on minimum length and on English and maths requirements will help businesses to offer workers the opportunity to add to their skills. DfE media enquiries Central newsdesk - for journalists 020 7783 8300', 'Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education Robert Halfon addressed the Skills for Growth Conference. It s great to be here to talk about how skills are intrinsically linked to productivity growth. Around a third of the productivity growth in the two decades to 2019 can be directly attributed to skills acquisition and education. We have a rich history of a skills culture in our country. Back in 1835, this site was home to the Westminster Hospital. The National Archives show the hospital employed apprentices here. That helps to illustrate that technical education has long been ingrained in our economic and social history. While we can all agree that skills are the catalyst for boosting economic growth and accelerating competitiveness, we lag behind our international peers. Indeed, UK employers spend about half of the European average on training for their employees. We must change that picture immediately especially when we have the solid foundations in place with all our skills offers for businesses to thrive. We must improve internationally. I am a huge admirer of German technical education. Presenting technical routes alongside academic ones from adolescent means there is no false hierarchy between the two. There is less snobbery about studying for a technical role one that will advance industry, and, by extension, the economy. And there is absolutely no hesitancy about showing the world of work to younger teenagers an environment that they are expected to take seriously, but where they are also taken seriously as well. When I first visited Germany in 2018, I found it inspiring. 14-year-olds on placements with local companies acquiring their first taste of industry and gaining the respect that comes with skilled labour. I remember asking business leaders at the Chamber of Commerce why they were providing placements after all, there was no financial incentive on offer. I was met with incredulity. What do you mean, why? We must do this, it s for the next generation! So embedded is the German sense of civic duty to pass on an understanding and respect for industry, they didn t understand the question. Yet I know from the employers that I meet, that we ve also got that passion in abundance in our country. We ve got to use that passion to show the impact skills can have on our young people, local communities, and our businesses. Whenever I talk about skills education, I articulate my vision through the Ladder of Opportunity. It s a framework for what we need to build a robust technical education system, to elevate skills levels, and crucially, to generate economic growth. Critically, the Ladder must bring progression opportunities to the most disadvantaged in society, so they can reach the top, to enjoy sustainable, skilled, and high-waged employment. The first rung of the ladder is careers empowerment. Careers must be about work experience and skills. Travelling across the country in National Apprenticeship Week, I heard from many apprentices that they had found out about apprenticeships from friends, Instagram, and TikTok, than hearing about them in school. We need to get carers advice right every single time. That advice must be impartial and comprehensive one that presents every option. Using the resources of the Careers and Enterprise Company, I will ensure schools prioritise careers guidance and enhance the quality of advice young people receive on all technical education routes. The second rung on my Ladder is about championing apprenticeships and skills that employers need. We now spend almost 100 of the apprenticeship budget in England. Government funding for high-quality apprenticeships will reach 2.7 billion by 2024-25. And the budget funds apprenticeships for all employers including those that do not pay the levy. It s vital that employers of all-sizes can connect with apprenticeships. I know there are voices calling for flexibilities around the levy. I listen intently to what employers are thinking around the levy. I also hear from significant numbers of employers who are vociferous advocates for what the levy is achieving today. Julie Hyett from AON is one of many giving her endorsement to the levy. She said: Our colleagues and the communities in which we operate, have benefitted hugely from proactive management of the levy .over 15 per cent of our UK workforce has enhanced their skills and gifting a 1 million to apprentices in small businesses across the country, the levy provides us with a unique opportunity to invest in the workforce of the future. We ve made it easier for large employers to transfer 25 per cent of levy funds to SMEs. You will all have a multitude of SMEs in your supply chains they are our great innovators. Since September 2021, a total of 320 employers including Amazon, Nat West, B Q, John Lewis, Serco, and National Grid have pledged to transfer over 21 million to support apprenticeships in other businesses. This year, we also plan to double the number of starts on the Skills Bootcamp: Pathway to Accelerated Apprenticeships model. This is about progression allowing individuals to get in via a Bootcamp and then get on into an apprenticeship. As we expand the delivery of Skills Bootcamps, we will also drive-up skills supply to a wider range of occupations in priority sectors. Employers can recruit directly off a Skills Bootcamp at no cost and you gain someone who has already tried and tested their new career and developed new skills. This means that these candidates hit the ground running on day one. And they become occupationally competent quickly. There is compelling evidence that learners can speed up their apprenticeship journey from between 3 to 6 months which includes their Skills Bootcamp stint. The combination of employers plus the skills sector creates a formidable force. It s one of the reasons behind the 21 new and imaginative Institutes of Technology. Backed by funding of 290 million, these are exciting collaborations between Education colleges, universities, and local employers. They are all working together to deliver high-quality technical education in subjects as diverse as advanced manufacturing, cyber security, and agri-tech. Employers involved include Microsoft, Gatwick Airport, Rolls Royce, Nissan, Airbus, and Siemens all helping to push our Higher Technical Qualifications agenda. The third rung of the ladder is about high-quality qualifications. High-quality is the DNA of apprenticeships. Let me be clear I will never compromise on quality. We now have over 670 apprenticeship Standards designed by employers, for employers. Covering science, fashion, engineering, broadcasting, construction the opportunities are endless. It s absolutely right that Standards are rigorous, challenging, and resilient because they have to meet the needs of employers. And apprentices must have the confidence that they will acquire the skills and knowledge needed in the global talent race. That s why I m incredibly proud of Degree apprenticeships. They are vital to supporting productivity and widening participation. Learners on Levels 6 and 7 now make up than 1 in 10 of all new apprenticeship starts. There s an amazingly diverse range of opportunities here including Police Constable, Registered Nurse, Chartered Surveyor, and Teacher providing alternative pathways into these sought-after professions. I also want to shine a light on T Levels. Employers have been firmly in the crosshairs for our new T Levels aimed at students aged 16 to 19. Again, this skills offer has been designed by hundreds of employers. T Levels give young people the knowledge and practical skills to galvanise your businesses. At the heart of each course, every T Level student completes an industry placement that lasts approximately 45 days. This gives you a unique opportunity to develop new talent, and get young people work-ready. The penultimate rung of the ladder is about lifelong learning. And there is now a new Lifelong Learning Entitlement. We need to give people the opportunity to train, retrain, and upskill throughout their lives to respond to the changing demands of businesses. Because careers are not linear. The robots are coming but we ll always need skilled people. The final rung of my Ladder is job security and prosperity. The skills system must support people into secure, sustained, and well-paid employment. For employers, skills are not only about reputation, recruitment, and relationships. Skills are about revenue and a strong return on investment. Apprenticeships, T Levels, Higher Technical Qualifications, Skills Bootcamps these programmes are the golden thread that can solve your skills gaps and build your promising talent pipelines. Today, our spotlight is on partnerships and dialogue. We want to work with you on what you need from the skills system. Ministers, my department s Non-Executive Directors, Senior Civil Servants all are here to listen to your challenges around skills training in your sectors. We understand why skills matters to UK plc. Now we want to understand your take on things as they stand. We are committed to working with you to ensure skills work for your business. And you have an essential role to play as well. Now is the time for you, as business leaders, to seize the moment and take ownership of your role as talent developers for UK plc. Now is the time for you, as enlightened employers, to invest in young people eager to make positive contributions to the world of work. Now is the time to expand the abilities of your existing teams, by re-skilling them to take advantage of new developments in your sector. You ve been able to meet some extraordinary young people today full of energy, creativity, determination, and a passion to succeed. You can create the opportunities these young people need. Your investment in skills will not only transform lives it will transform your businesses. We will be with you every step of the way. Today s conversations are a decisive starting point to a better skills system and a burgeoning economy. Pledge to get behind skills, and we pledge to back you. Thank you for listening.

The new project will explore the impact of outsourcing and how contracting practices affect care provision. Family change, wellbeing and social policy , led by Professor Susan Harkness University of Bristol This project will explore how family living arrangements have changed, how this affects adults and children s access to resources, and the implications for policy. In the UK, over 40 of children born in 2000 were not living with both biological parents by age 11. Despite increased family complexity, welfare and child maintenance systems still operate under outdated assumptions about family structure, while means testing has expanded and places a greater emphasis on family income in the welfare system. This potentially leaves some children and adults without adequate financial support, especially in complex family arrangements. Roots of problem debt and policies to mitigate its consequences , led by Dr Laura Fumagalli University of Essex This project, in partnership with the Money and Pension Service MaPS , will explore how people get into debt and subsequently manage their credit commitments, and the effectiveness of debt advice. One of the main policy interventions to support individuals in problem debt is providing free debt advice. However, evidence of its effectiveness is mainly qualitative or correlational. The research will address this gap by collecting a new dataset, the Longitudinal Survey of Debt Advice LSDA , which will be used to investigate how useful it is to encourage people in problem debt to seek advice. Routes to safety: Enhancing referrals to make victims of domestic abuse safer, sooner , led by Nanya Coles SafeLives This project will use the SafeLives Insights database to produce new on referral pathways and outcomes for survivors of domestic violence. Insights is used by frontline services in 36 local authorities across England, Wales, and the Channel Islands. It contains individual-level data for over 90,000 adults, and 9,600 children and young people, about the violence and abuse they experience, the support they receive, and their outcomes. Policy and practice recommendations will be developed with survivors and practitioners, and through a spotlight report they ll aim to disseminate to policy, commissioning, practice, and research audiences. details about the new projects in education Achieving high-quality provision in the baby room of English nurseries , led by Dr Mona Sakr Middlesex University This project will gather evidence on what quality provision looks like in the baby rooms of English nurseries. By September 2025, all children under five with working parents who meet the criteria, will be eligible for 30 hours of free early years provision. This is likely to lead to increased scrutiny of the care and education of 0-2-year-olds. Initial global research shows there is a large knowledge gap on what happens in the baby room, and how practice could improve. Out of sight: Exclusions, alternative provision, and later life outcomes , led by Dave Thomson FFT Education Datalab This project will explore how removing disruptive pupils from schools affects their education, labour market, crime, and health outcomes. Research has typically focused on inequalities whereby certain groups are disproportionately likely to be excluded, or on correlational evidence showing wide-ranging negative outcomes of exclusion. However, there is little research on the causal relationship between outcomes and exclusions. An international analysis of SEND policy and practice: ScopeSEND , led by Dr Susana Castro-Kemp UCL Institute of Education This project will compare policies regulating provision for Special Educational Needs and Disabilities SEND in the four countries of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, Australia, Switzerland, Belgium and Finland. The goal is to influence SEND policy change in England, as the new government reviews the 2023 SEND and alternative provision improvement plan. Early years digital media literacy review , led by Cliff Manning Parent and Family Consulting Ltd This project will explore how digital literacy support can be improved for families of under-5s in the UK. Eighty seven percent of parents say their 3 4 year old children go online at home or elsewhere. Official guidance for under-5s often focuses on screen time restrictions rather than the content being accessed. Existing research on under-5s focuses on the effect digital media may have on child development, not on how children s development can be supported to include and benefit from digital media and technology. Assessing and improving language-supporting practice in the early years , led by Dr Sandra Mathers University of Oxford This project will assess the impact of the Talking Time intervention on Early Years Practitioner EYP outcomes, and is co-funded with the Education Endowment Foundation EEF . Many children experience language delays, particularly those from disadvantaged families. Equipping EYPs to support language learning is essential to address disparities. This project will explore the impact of Talking Time on EYP practice outcomes, specifically, how EYPs support children s language development. Beyond teacher assessed grades: Post 16 education choices and COVID-19 , led by Sam Tuckett Education Policy Institute This project will investigate the impact of Teacher and Centre Assessed Grades on young people s qualification choices and course completion rates in the 16-19 phase of education, and and higher education. The higher grades achieved by students during the pandemic may have affected students transitions, influencing the types of qualifications they applied for, specific subjects, or their chosen institutions. This is unlikely to have affected all students equally, as disadvantage gaps widened during the pandemic. Exploring school-college partnerships for 14-18 learners in Scotland , led by Dr Stephanie Thomson University of Aberdeen This project will investigate school-college partnerships SCPs , which offer students in Scotland aged 14-18 the opportunity to undertake this phase of education at both a school and a college. The team will produce new insights into the characteristics of young people taking SCPs, the types of provision, and the experiences of learners and staff. The research aims to improve national evidence on SCPs, enhance practice, and inform policy development in Scottish and beyond. The project is being delivered in partnership with the College Development Network . Educational dialogue for improving Foundation Year student outcomes , led by Dr Marion Heron University of Surrey This project aims to improve Foundation Year students oral language skills to increase learning outcomes, retention and progression. The number of Foundation Year students moving onto undergraduate programmes is low, and students completing a Foundation Year are less likely to complete a degree than direct-entry peers. One potential is a lack of oral language skills, in particular educational dialogue, which is classroom talk in which students build on and challenge each other s ideas. The project will develop and evaluate teacher resources to promote students use of educational dialogue. Employer investment in upskilling and reskilling in a changing economy , led by Naomi Clayton Learning and Work Institute This project will explore employer investment in skills, and employee responses to the need to upskill and retrain in a transitioning economy affected by advances in technology and the shift to net zero. UK employer investment in training has fallen by 26 per employee since 2005 and is now half the EU average, with large inequalities in access to training. The study aims to shape long-term strategies for skills investment by co-designing practical solutions for policymakers at the UK, devolved, and local government levels, and for employers and training providers. Accountability and curriculum international review and CES exemplar , led by Loic Menzies Centre for Education Systems, incubated by the Education Policy Institute This project will support the development of a new organisation that will be the first to co-ordinate international research on macro policy to inform policy making. The Centre for Education Systems CES will strive to synthesise evidence, make it usable, and represent a consolidated source of authoritative and insight to inform education policy. Evaluating the Fundamental British Values initiative of the DfE , led by Dr Ozan Aksoy UCL Institute of Education This project will explore the consequences of the Department for Education s Fundamental British Values FBV initiative, launched in 2014. The FBV s are: democracy, rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect, and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. The policy aimed to promote a shared Britishness and prevent violent extremism. The research team will assess the intended, and unintended consequences of the FBV initiative. details about the new projects in Justice SEND complaints and the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman , led by Professor Robert Thomas University of Manchester This project will provide an evidenced-based understanding of the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman s LGSCO influence over local authorities, and how this could be enhanced to address administrative problems in Special Education Needs and Disability SEND provision. One of the LGSCO s roles is identifying underlying systemic problems and issuing service improvement recommendations to councils. This research aims to develop evidence around the nature of the faults identified, their underlying causes, and how councils can use this learning to improve SEND provision. Immigrant Families in the Family Justice System , led by Professor Renee Luthra University of Essex This project will investigate how the immigration experience influences parental separation in immigrant families. A 2023 House of Lords Justice and Home Affairs Committee inquiry highlighted how Brexit, hostile environment migration policies, and the tightening of the immigration system have disrupted the lives of families. The uncertainty, difficulties in maintaining relationships, and financial burden create pressures on relationships. The researchers will work with third-sector organisations and law practitioners to co-create and disseminate outputs, including best practice briefings for legal practitioners, and to improve signposting and access to for immigrant families. Understanding the circumstances of children involved in breach proceedings , led by Helen Hodges Swansea University This project will explore how being a vulnerable child increases the likelihood of breaching criminal court requirements. Despite efforts to divert children from the formal youth justice system, vulnerable children, particularly from deprived areas, are over-represented in court. Between April 2013 and March 2022 there were 21,953 proven Breaches of Statutory Order offences by children in England and Wales. Limited research so far suggests that the children who have the most difficulty complying with the conditions are not the most serious offenders but those who offend persistently, and have strong links with disadvantages and vulnerability. Immigration Detention and the Rule of Law , led by Dr Jean-Pierre Gauci British Institute of International and Comparative Law This project will update safeguarding principles on immigration detention, first published by the British Institute of International and Comparative Law in 2013, to ensure they reflect the developments and continue to function as a practical resource. Immigration detention is widely used across many countries and regions, and the privatisation and externalisation of detention are increasingly mainstream. Practices including the use of Bibby Stockholm barge and Wethersfield airfield to detain migrants have raised questions about adherence to the rule of law. Interested in applying for funding? We have two application rounds in spring and autumn for the Research, Development and Analysis Fund . To keep in touch with key dates and learn about our work sign up for our newsletter.', 'We want to work with researchers, policymakers and practitioners to define our future priorities The Nuffield Foundation is setting a new strategy and we are launching a year-long programme of consultation with our stakeholders. Beginning in July 2023, the Changing lives for the better programme will invite researchers, policymakers and practitioners from different disciplines and institutions to a series of events to help us set our new strategy, and fund the research best placed to improve people s lives. We are committed to increasing our spending by 30m to 130m over the next five years. However, in the agenda we want to explore, we are thinking across the next twenty years. Our purpose The Nuffield Foundation was founded in 1943, 80 years ago. Our challenge is to re-shape for the 21st century the Foundation s original objects the advancement of social well-being, the advancement of education, the relief of disability and the challenges of ageing. Life in Britain today is in many ways unrecognisable to that of the mid-20th century in its diversity and demography, the structure of work, families and communities, and the accelerating impact of technology. But there are also persistent themes that connect the present to the past access to opportunities, inequalities, education and the fairness of the justice system. The challenge of Nuffield s research is to produce that shock of understanding as to what sort of society we are becoming and to help change it for the better. Our approach Nuffield looks to its grant-holders to define these questions and identify the evidence from the available data. Nuffield s mindset is primarily empirical. It believes in the power of evidence to change lives and is concerned with the complex trade-offs around the most intractable challenges to social policy. But our purpose is also underpinned by a normative framing identifying the foundations, obstacles and pathways to a just and inclusive society that no policy programme should ignore. We do not fund advocacy, but we do expect research to trace a direct line to the improvement of people s lives, especially those of the least advantaged. Our best projects connect the rigour of quantitative analysis to the disciplines of qualitative research, extracting and testing the data but never reducing the lived experience buried in that data to a set of graphs and numbers. As we scan the horizon, we believe certain definitional questions will persist the extent to which a largely prosperous society can manage aspects of inequality and the risks across the life course, from the early years into old age. Our research ranges across questions of income, wealth, education, public health and disability. It should consider geography, class, gender and race, and intergenerational differences the intersectionality that recognises people live in many different social categories at one time. Our projects interrogate public policy outcomes the idiom of government but they can also be most telling when they map the intermeshed experiences of our diverse communities and how they shape individual lives. Childhood and education have always been Nuffield s core interests; identifying the different threads in a child s life that determine educational opportunity and attainment. The Nuffield Family Justice Observatory provides empirical evidence to inform decision-making about our most vulnerable children. The Justice system is central to our interests. If it does not offer access to redress and protect the individual s rights in relation to the state, then trust in a just society may be compromised and the basis for social well-being will flounder. In all these ways, we bring into focus the different aspects of the relationships between a caring and a productive society. A society shaped by artificial intelligence and climate change In the idealism of post war Britain, Nuffield research, notably in computing and genetics, reflected a belief that the advancement of social well-being would be shaped by advances in science. Eighty years on, we are at a point where the scale of technological impact, in genomics and artificial intelligence, and the intrusion of digital systems into all aspects of our lives shape any question we now ask of how society might work and fit together. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics, founded in 1993, and the Ada Lovelace Institute, founded in 2018, are the two pillars on which we can develop an agenda that will increasingly be integral to all our work. The urgency of the debate on artificial intelligence is driven by existential questions but there are also applied questions concerning the potential benefits and risks of these technologies to the provision of education, public health, welfare, care and justice. Nuffield in the future must encourage research programmes that connect the algorithmic logic of data science to the wicked questions of social science, within robust ethical thinking. How do we ensure digitally determined solutions bring benefits and also take account of individual experience and cultural difference? Similarly, one cannot consider our social welfare if one does not take account of how the rapidity of climate change bears down on questions of social geography, inequality and disadvantage, and how a just transition to a net zero society must be an inextricable part of the wider determinants of a just society. A partnership with those we fund and who use our research As a funder, we can set out our ambitions, but it will be our grant-holders and partners who will refine the research questions. We have worked with some partners over many years; we also are looking for new talent who recognise and represent the diversity and changing character of our society. Over the coming months we want to co-create our programme: Changing lives for the better: priorities for the next twenty years. We want to create a network of researchers from across different disciplines, inside our universities and beyond, those in local, regional and national government, in civic society, in policy formulation and professional practice. We need to connect with the creativity of those in business and enterprise who will define employability and skills of the future, and those working within the fabric of our diverse communities. We encourage you all to come forward with the most salient and urgent research questions society needs to answer. We want to hear from you Find out about our Changing lives for the better programme Or get in touch to share your thoughts and ideas for our future priorities. We look forward to hearing from you.', 'Funding awarded to 21 projects to tackle inequalities and support social well-being The Nuffield Foundation is delighted to announce support for 21 new projects in its funding round. A total of 4.75m is going to a range of research teams across England, Scotland and Wales, for projects addressing key social issues affecting people s lives. Topics for research across our three main areas of interest Education, Welfare, and Justice include: These projects join our portfolio of than 200 active grants, with childhood charities Thrive at Five and Early Education, both receiving their first grant from the Foundation. We look forward to working closely with our new grant-holders and supporting them to produce insights and evidence that address the inequalities, disadvantages and vulnerabilities that many people face. New education projects Implementing effective early education interventions at scale , led by Dr Christine O Farrelly University of Cambridge This project is evaluating the Playtime with Books programme, which supports families to engage young children 10-24 months in high-quality book-sharing interactions to enhance early learning. The study will test the programme at scale in two local authorities, to support the large-scale roll-out of the intervention, and provide insights into the successful scaling of effective, early years interventions. Outputs will include an online programme, a training package, and an implementation guide. A comparative analysis of EY workforce policy in the four UK nations , led by Professor Dame Cathy Nutbrown Early Education This project aims to address the crisis in the UK early years workforce by comparing recent policies across the four home nations. The study involves a review of national and international literature and interviews with key stakeholders to identify successful policies and areas for improvement. The findings will highlight strengths and weaknesses of each nation s systems, and generate ideas for policymakers to support effective early learning and improve outcomes for children. Clear skies, clear minds: Air quality and children s welfare , led by Dr Ludovica Gazze University of Warwick This project is investigating the impact of air pollution on children s health and educational outcomes in England since the early 2000s. The research will explore the short- and medium-term effects of pollution on educational attainment, physical health, and mental health, and how these interact. It will also explore if the quality of public services and amenities can mediate these effects. Using the new Education and Child Health Insights from Linked Data ECHILD dataset, the study will analyse the records of approximately 20m children in England aged 2-16. Findings will enhance understanding of how societal transformations, like net-zero, are shaping children s futures through changes in local pollution, and will inform strategies to mitigate pollution s detrimental effects. The evaluation of Thrive at Five s sites in Stoke and Redcar , led by Chris Welling Thrive at Five This project evaluates Thrive at Five s holistic, place-based model which aims to strengthen early years systems, practices and support pathways. Implemented in Stoke-on-Trent and Redcar and Cleveland, the model targets approximately 2,500 children aged 0-5 and their families. The research will conduct a mixed-methods implementation and impact evaluation. The research will explore if Thrive at Five is being implemented as intended, and if there is evidence of impact in the short, medium, and longer-term. The goal is to refine and replicate the model, influence national policy and practice, and improve early childhood outcomes in disadvantaged communities. Examining the challenges and benefits of childminding in England , led by Professor Lynn Ang UCL Institute of Education This project will examine the benefits and challenges of working as a childminder and explore the evidence about the impact of childminding and the characteristics of high-quality practice. The study will include an evidence review, a national survey, and interviews with childminders and parents. Workshops and meetings with stakeholders will help co-produce recommendations. Findings will inform policy to support recruitment, retention and working conditions. They will also speak to the government s priority of early intervention and childcare improving the life chances of every child. Youth transitions to good employment: East Birmingham North Solihull, led by Professor Anne Green University of Birmingham This project will investigate the transitions of young people aged 16-24 into good employment in East Birmingham and North Solihull EBNS . Through a mixed-methods approach, the research will explore employment and skills support accessibility, future job opportunities, employer perspectives, young people s pathways to good employment, and policy insights. It involves secondary data analysis, surveys, and interviews with schools, employers, and young people. The project will be delivered collaboratively by the University of Birmingham with Birmingham City Council, Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council, Demos, and the West Midlands Combined Authority. Findings will guide policymakers and stakeholders to improve support, integrate young people into the workforce, and foster inclusive economic growth. Impact of school breakfast programmes , led by Professor Birgitta Rabe, University of Essex This project will examine the impact of free breakfast schemes on children s well-being and academic outcomes in English primary schools. Researchers will use data from three major providers Magic Breakfast, Greggs Foundation, and the National School Breakfast Programme , linked with national datasets on pupils school records, weight, and social-emotional behaviour. They will explore the roll-out of free school breakfast schemes across schools over time, comparing the outcomes of children within schools who were early and late adopters of free breakfast provision. Findings will provide evidence on the benefits of different schemes, in different types of schools, and for different groups of children, helping determine the best way to deliver free breakfasts. The uneven distribution of pupils with SEND in mainstream schools , led by Matt Walker National Foundation for Educational Research This project will explore the uneven distribution of pupils with special educational needs and disabilities SEND across mainstream schools in England, particularly in secondary schools. The research includes analysing national data to define High SEND and Low SEND schools, investigating school moves among SEND pupils, conducting interviews with local authorities and case studies in High SEND schools, and surveying school leaders to understand differences in support and barriers. Findings will inform policymakers and school leaders, with the aim of improving SEND policies, funding, and practices to create a inclusive education system. Improving wellbeing-focused online media literacy in schools , led by Dr Beth Bell University of York This project explores the effectiveness of well-being-focused online media literacy interventions in English secondary schools. The study is in three stages: a systematic review to identify effective interventions, interviews with Relationships, Sex and Health Education teachers to understand barriers, and collaboration with educators to develop guidance and three sample lesson plans. The overall aim is to enhance young people s ability to navigate online risks and support their well-being. New welfare projects Tackling the gap in retirement saving decisions , led by Dr Vivien Burrows International Longevity Centre UK This project explores the people trust and use when making retirement saving decisions and the influence of the media on their choices. The research will analyse the sources people use when making retirement saving decisions, explore the role played by different types of media, and identify gaps in quality, reach, and impact in the financial available to different groups of people, and how this influences their decisions. The project will also develop a toolkit with recommendations in providing to better support financial planning for later life. How can low earners afford a commensurate retirement income? , led by Tim Pike, Pensions Policy Institute This project examines pension savings and retirement outcomes for low earners. The study aims to understand the characteristics and diverse labour market experiences within this group. The study will analyse typical life courses of low earners, their workplace pension behaviours, and how these factors influence retirement income. The team will also assess how alternative approaches to savings, affect retirement outcomes and affordability during working years. The research involves a literature review, data analysis, examination of workplace pension contributions, and modelling of retirement incomes. Findings will inform policy ideas to enhance pension savings and retirement outcomes for low earners. Distributional impacts of net zero on electricity consumers , led by Dr Malte Jensen University College London This project explores how net zero policies affect different groups of electricity consumers, particularly in terms of their incomes and energy costs. Analysing real energy use data and connecting it to the Family Resources Survey, the research team aims to provide policymakers with a better understanding of changing household energy consumers in the UK and the impact on their incomes and outgoings of the net zero transition. They will also evaluate the effects of tax and welfare policies. Findings will be shared through reports and policy briefings, and expert workshops will be held to discuss and test policy ideas aimed at reducing inequality, supporting decarbonisation, and ensuring political feasibility. Impact of the cost of childcare on parental mobility , led by Dr Su-Min Lee London Economics This project will investigate the impact of formal childcare costs and availability on parental mobility and the labour market. The team will analyse how parental mobility is affected by different aspects of childcare. Researchers will conduct a survey and choice experiment with 4,000 parents to assess the importance of childcare in migration decisions, and compare the economic impact of different childcare policies. The findings will provide policymakers, childcare providers, and researchers with better guidance, and contribute to development in policies to improve accessibility to childcare, and reduce economic barriers for working families. Characterising the job ladder in England , led by Greg Thwaites Resolution Foundation This project investigates job mobility in England, analysing who climbs the job ladder, when, and why. Using new Longitudinal Educational Outcomes LEO data, the research team will consider, What does England s job ladder look like? How does it shape wage differences? Who climbs the ladder, based on educational, demographic, socioeconomic and geographic characteristics? Has job switching declined, and if so, why? The study will use econometric analysis to examine individual and firm-level job changes and assess local labour market influences. Findings will inform policymakers and contribute to debates on labour market dynamics, wage disparities, and mobility trends, shaping future economic and employment policies. All women are born un equal: menopause, HRT and women s well-being , led by Professor Gabriella Conti University College London This project examines the impact of menopause and Hormone Replacement Therapy HRT on various aspects of women s lives, addressing key gaps in research. The study will analyse large-scale datasets, including the 1970 British Cohort Study and UK Biobank, to assess the effects of menopause, variations in HRT uptake, and its causal impact. It will also explore differences in experiences by ethnicity, education, and disadvantage. Additionally, interviews with a diverse group of women will provide valuable context. Findings will help shape policies and interventions to improve menopause care and support women s well-being across different socio-economic backgrounds. Digital lives framework for counsellors and psychotherapists , led by Dr Aiman El Asam Kingston University London This project will explore how understanding the risks, harms, and benefits of digital life can be better integrated into therapy for children and adolescents with mental health challenges. In partnership with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy BACP , the study will develop a Digital Lives Framework and training programme to improve professional practice. Research will involve surveys and interviews with therapists and young people, helping to shape evidence-based guidance. The framework will inform policy and practice, while an accredited CPD training programme will provide resources for practitioners. Findings will be shared with counselling professionals, policymakers, and educational institutions. Full Fact: Evidence-based responses to harmful misinformation , led by Chris Morris Full Fact This project continues the Foundation s support for Full Fact in its work to explore and respond to the impact of misinformation and poor quality, particularly in an era of generative AI. Full Fact will use fact checking and policy expertise to ensure the UK s policy approach to harmful misinformation is proportionate and effective. They will also build their work relating to climate change and decarbonisation, an issue that will play a major role in policy and public debate. Three Annual Reports will offer recommendations for change. The work will aim to help the government develop new policies to address misinformation, legislate for risks and opportunities of generative AI, and act as a state of the nation on misinformation and associated risks. Findings will be shared with key stakeholders, including government bodies, parliamentary committees, researchers, and tech companies. New justice projects The forgotten 10 : private family law cases involving non-parents , led by Dr Linda Cusworth, Lancaster University This project is examining the circumstances, experiences and views of children, families, and professionals in private law cases with non-parents, such as grandparents, aunts uncles, and siblings. In collaboration with Kinship and Families in Harmony, the aims of this unique study include identifying evidence gaps, exploring how the family justice system responds to the needs of families, and building research expertise within lived-experience organisations. Findings will be shared with policymakers, the judiciary, and practitioners through policy briefings, roundtable events, and a research toolkit, to inform family justice reforms, and ensure better support for the forgotten 10 in private law cases. Understanding and developing user-focused tribunal hearings , led by Professor Chris Gill University of Glasgow This project will examine how tribunals have developed user-focused approaches following legislative reform and modernisation. Focusing on hearings in social security, housing, and education tribunals, researchers aim to compare approaches to hearings between different tribunal chambers and those operating on a Great Britain, England-only, and Scotland-only basis. They will examine how the judicialisation of the tribunal system affects the conduct of hearings and their user-focus. Additionally, the team will compare various hearing formats, and different hearing practices, to determine if they meet users needs. They will also explore how lay members contribute to user focus, identify best practices for user-focused hearings, assess their transferability, and develop a bottom-up understanding of user focus. Developing a mixed funding model for free legal advice , led by Professor Linda Mulcahy, University of Oxford This project will explore potential creative and supplementary funding models to secure a sustainable future for the legal advice sector, which plays a crucial role in supporting vulnerable communities. The team will answer eight key questions, including what funding schemes exist internationally, what are their characteristics, and how do they facilitate access to justice for the disadvantaged. Each stage of research will be informed by stakeholder engagement workshops involving jurisdictional experts, lawyers, advice providers, financiers, regulators, insurers, economists, and academics. Findings will be shared through an open-access database, an evaluation framework, policy briefings, and a national conference. Through collaboration with policymakers and practitioners, this project aims to drive informed debate and practical solutions, ensuring long-term financial sustainability for the sector while enhancing access to justice. Developing a digital legal knowledge hub for social welfare law , led by Sue James Legal Action Group This project will digitise the Law and Practice section of Legal Action Group smagazine, Legal Action , and develop a free online hub for case law and materials on social welfare law. Through the hub, the project team aims to transform the interaction between lawmakers, campaigners, and citizens. It s hoped the hub is expected to actas a forum for exchanging and ideas, encourage the next generation of legal aid and social justice lawyers, train users on the use of law to secure social change, improve people s access to legal , and raise awareness of access to justice issues .']",Education research and evidence foundations

Gillian Keegan gives opening address at Bett 2024 Thank you and good morning. What a pleasure it is to be back here to open Bett 2024. Since I stood on this stage in March last year, we ve seen generative AI continue to develop at pace and spark conversations all over the globe. These conversations have highlighted some of the opportunities and the challenges that AI might bring. Last week I spoke with Sal Khan who runs the Khan Academy in the US, who many of you will know. Sal s spoken previously about the risks associated with using AI in education, including how students use ChatGPT. He shares my view that whilst we need to mitigate those risks, we re approaching a time when we will see a monumental shift in the way in which technology is used in education. At the Khan Academy, they re using AI to generate personalised tutors for students and virtual assistants for teachers. In a recent meeting, Sal demonstrated how the AI can facilitate debates with students, provide instant feedback to learners, help design a bespoke curriculum and can even imitate a fictional character to bring learning to life. So, imagine a school where every student and teacher has the support of artificial intelligence. Imagine the power of bringing a virtual George Washington into the classroom to explain his role in the Revolutionary War. Imagine how this can improve educational experiences for children and teachers. But whilst we re considering opportunities for the future, it s important that we don t ignore the challenges that come with using cutting-edge technology. Last year, the Prime Minister hosted the AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park to consider the risks associated with introducing these new technologies and discuss how they can be mitigated. The summit confirmed the UK s ambition to take the lead on safety and set the standard for other countries across the world. As part of that ambition, we ve introduced a new AI Safety Institute, which will ensure that the UK and the rest of the world are not caught off guard by rapid and unexpected advances in technology. A key principle of the institute will be to share its findings with the rest of the world, ensuring that we re building a global response to both the opportunities and risks that come with AI. In education, we re continuing to work closely with our regulators and the Office for Artificial Intelligence to make sure we re using this technology responsibly. I want to reassure you that when new technologies are emerging, our top priority is the safety of young people. No matter how prepared we think we are, we need enough skilled people to ensure we grasp the opportunities and tackle any challenges that AI might bring. That s why we ve introduced 21 Institutes of Technology, bringing education and business even closer together. At the South Central Institute of Technology, based next door to the famous Bletchley Park, they ve gone from code-breaking to code-making. One of their first alumni, Deborah, came to the UK from Kenya at the age of 14. She studied for a HND in cyber security and has spoken about how the institute helped her to develop the skills she needed to secure her future. These are the results that we need to see everywhere. These are the results that will help us to prepare for the future. Higher technical qualifications, designed to help learners get the right training and skills they need, are available with over 60 qualifications approved in the digital sector. Last year, over 22,000 learners across the country started on one of 30 digital apprenticeships, designed by leading employers. These apprenticeships are helping us to train data scientists, software developers and network engineers, just to name a few. We re also scaling up the delivery of our Skills Bootcamps to help transform the adult skills landscape and we ve set an ambitious target of reaching 64,000 learners in key growth areas, including digital and green skills, by March next year. I recently heard about Raymond, who graduated from university and found himself working in temporary jobs with no prospect for progression. He decided to sign-up for the Level 4 Microsoft IT engineer Skills Bootcamp to gain knowledge of Azure cloud computing. The 12 weeks intensive training that Raymond received gave him the knowledge he needed to secure a job in cloud computing. These are the opportunities that we re providing to ensure we prepare for our future by building a skilled workforce. I want to turn your attention to the work we re doing internationally to support the introduction of AI into education. We re working closely with many countries to share best practice when it comes to bringing AI and education closer together. One example is Estonia. They re introducing a model whereby teachers set the strategy, students set their preferences and AI will do the planning and measuring to deliver a bespoke learning path for each student. The students get personalised feedback to improve their learning and the teachers get diagnostics to help them understand how their pupils are performing and where they can improve. Our work with the Japanese government, which included a request to translate our statement on AI in education, really highlights the value of collaboration at pace. Whist Japan learns from us, we re also learning from them. During my visit to the G7 last year, I saw how they re using state of the art technology to support their students studying topics including AI and gaming. They too are learning the pros and cons of an AI world and I m pleased that we re working together to grasp these opportunities and mitigate those risks. To ensure that the schools and colleges of this country are prepared to embrace the future, they need to have the basics in place. We re delivering fibre internet infrastructure to another 800 schools who wouldn t otherwise have access to ultra-fast broadband. Over 2,600 schools have already benefitted from wireless upgrades through our connect the classroom programme. By this time next year, 3,700 schools from priority areas, such as Blackpool and Ipswich, will benefit from a new wireless network. To help schools understand the basics, we ve published a set of straightforward standards, with the three released just this month. These guidelines support better decision making, ensure schools are buying what s right for them and that the technology is accessible for everyone. Moving from the basics, I was recently impressed by the City of Liverpool College s motion capture suite, which started in gaming, and now they re using it to develop skills and solve problems for the nearby businesses. Their ability to create virtual layouts of hospitals and help patients prepare for treatments was truly inspiring, but I know this level of technology is not yet available in all schools and colleges. We need the tools, data and systems that work together to reduce the burden on our teachers. But we should have the same expectations for robust evidence in EdTech as we do elsewhere in education. EdTech businesses should be leading the way, being transparent with buyers and promoting products based on great evidence. So, today we re publishing our research on AI in education, having brought together views from our world-leading experts and educators. The research highlights that as of November last year, 42 of primary and secondary teachers had used generative AI in their role, an increase from 17 in April just last year. This is hard evidence that highlights the rapid increase in the use of these tools. I want to encourage countries to continue sharing evidence as it s generated, so we can all better harness the opportunities to make a real difference in classrooms across the world. Finally, we need to encourage exactly what is on display here today at Bett 2024. Innovation. This country s EdTech sector contains a wealth of innovators and leaders who are looking to that future. Alongside them are the brilliant educators, hundreds of whom responded to our recent call for evidence which told us how generative AI is saving hours of planning time and helping to reduce workloads. AI is becoming part of daily life and our young people are starting to think about what it means for them and their future. Last month, I spoke with students at Claverham and Heathfield community colleges about how they re using technology in the classroom and what AI might mean for their education. They talked to me about how to use tools like ChatGPT to help with their revision and not just do their homework quickly. They also spoke about the need to use the technology safely. I left feeling reassured that our young people are willing to embrace the changes that AI will make to the classroom, but that they re also aware of the challenges it might bring. I also want to reassure those of you who think that AI, or any other technology, is somehow going to replace our brilliant teachers. It is not. No technology can replace them. It s about giving them the confidence they need to succeed. Even Bill Gates once said: technology is just a tool, in terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the teacher is the most important and of course giving them that confidence they will need to succeed in life. I hope you all have a brilliant Bett 2024 conference. I know you ll be looking forward to hearing the fantastic speakers coming up such as Louis Theroux and Loyle Carner up next, as well as Tasha Ghouri later this afternoon. All that s left for me to say is, keep innovating, keep sharing and keep learning! Thank you. Updates to this Explore the topic Education, training and skills', 'Schools could use AI to help write letters to parents, give feedback to pupils and come up with ideas for lessons, new government toolkits have said. The guidance, published today and drawn up by the Chiltern Learning Trust and Chartered College of Teaching, also says schools should plan for wider use of AI including to analyse budgets and help plan CPD. Government said the toolkits are part of a new innovation drive , which includes investment to accelerate development of AI marking and feedback tools. A new pilot has also beenlaunched to trial tools in testbeds schools. The government previously produced guidance on safety expectations for the use of generative AI artificial intelligence that creates content in education, along with policy papers and research on the subject. Education secretary Bridget Phillipson said: By harnessing AI s power to cut workloads, we re revolutionising classrooms and driving high standards everywhere breaking down barriers to opportunity so every child can achieve and thrive. Here s what you need to know on the new toolkits which can be viewed in full here For teaching and learning, the documents state generative AI may be able to support ideas for lesson content and structure, formative assessments, analysis of marking data and creating text in a specific style, length or reading age . On assessments, the guidance says this could include quiz generation from specific content or offering feedback on errors. AI could also support with data analysis of marking . It can also produce images to support understanding of a concept or as an exemplar , exam-style questions from set texts, and visual resources, like slide decks, knowledge organisers and infographics , a slide in one of the toolkits adds. The toolkits also say technology could support cutting down time spent on admin, like email and letter writing, data analysis and long-term planning. One example given is producing a letter home for parents about an outbreak of head lice. The toolkit says policy writing, timetabling, trip planning and staff CPD were other areas in which it could be used. In smaller settings, AI can help streamline administrative tasks such as rota management and ensuring staff-to-child ratios are optimised in line with statutory requirements, among other uses . But leaders have been also told to plan for AI s wider use . The writers of the reports say some finance teams are using safe and approved tools to analyse budgets and support planning. Business managers are also using it to generate tender documents based on a survey of requirements . By involving all school or college staff in CPD on AI, you can help improve efficiency and effectiveness across operations ultimately having a positive impact on pupil and student outcomes. The guidance suggests integrating AI into management systems . This can can give insights that may not otherwise be possible, and these insights could support interventions around behaviour, attendance and progress . According to the DfE, the technology offers valuable tools to support learners with SEND by adapting materials to individual learning needs and providing personalised instruction and feedback . For example, it can take a scene and describe it in detail to those who are visually impaired . But specialists and education, health and care plans EHCPs should be consulted to help identify specific needs and consider carefully whether an AI tool is the most appropriate solution on a case-by-case basis . Meanwhile, many programmes are multilingual and could be used with pupils, students and families who have English as an additional language . As the technology becomes prevalent, integrating AI literacy and critical thinking into existing lessons and activities should be considered . For example, AI ethics and digital citizenship could be incorporated into PSHE or computing curriculums. Some schools and colleges have promoted AI literacy within their curricula, including through the use of resources provided by the National Centre for Computing Education . This ensures youngsters understand how systems work, their limitations and potential biases. Approaches to homework may also have to be considered, focusing on tasks that can t be easily completed by AI . The guidance added many systems will simply provide an answer rather than explain the process and so do not contribute to the learning process . The guidance stresses it s essential schools are clear with staff around what tools are safe to use and how they can use them . Those included on the list should have been assessed and allow schools control over them. Writing vision statements , created in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders , have been recommended so you can be clear on the benefits you expect to achieve and how you can do this safely . As part of this, they have been warned about two issues inherent in AI systems: hallucinations and bias. The former are inaccuracies in an otherwise factual output . Meanwhile, bias can occur if there was bias in the data that it was trained on, or the developer could have intentionally or unintentionally introduced bias or censorship into the model . Schools should also consider factors such as inclusivity, accessibility, cost-effectiveness and compliance with internal privacy and security policies. A key consideration listed in the guidance is whether its output has a clear, positive impact on staff workload and or the learning environment . It is also essential no decision that could adversely impact a student s outcomes is based purely on AI without human review and oversight . An example of this is generating a student s final mark or declining their admission based on an AI-generated decision . The guidance said: Transparency and human oversight are essential to ensure AI systems assist, but do not replace, human decision-making. The toolkits also issue warnings over mental health apps, which they say must be regulated by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory authority . There were broader warnings about using AI. The guidance notes that pupils work may be protected under intellectual property laws even if it does not contain personal data . To safeguard against this, schools should be certain AI marking tools do not train on the work that we enter and have parental consent. Copyright breaches can also happen if the systems are trained on unlicensed material and the outputs are then used in educational settings or published widely . Schools should ensure AI systems comply with UK GDPR rules before using them. If it stores, learns from, or shares the data, staff could be breaching data protection law . Any AI use must also be line with the keeping children safe in education guidance. Most free sites will not be suitable for student use as they will not have the appropriate safeguards in place and the AI tool or model may learn on the prompts and that is input . Child protection policies should be updated to reflect the rapidly changing risks from AI use as well. The guidance also says newsletters and school websites could provide regular updates on AI and online safety guidelines . Parental workshops can extend the online safety net beyond school or college boundaries . The increasing accessibility of AI image generation tools also presents new challenges to schools, the guidance added. Proactive measures , like initiatives to educate students, staff and parents about this risk, have been identified as essential to minimise this potential harm . Schools have also been told to conduct regular staff training on identifying and responding to online risks, including AI-generated sexual extortion . These sessions should be recurring to address emerging threats . Government guidance for frontline staff on how to respond to incidents where nudes and semi-nudes have been shared also applies to incidents where sexualised deep-fakes computer-generated images have been created and shared, the guidance continued.', 'Hackathon to test how artificial intelligence could reduce workloads and drive up standards. Teachers and school leaders from across England are set to participate in an artificial intelligence AI hackathon as part a two-day event to experiment with technology and identify how AI could supercharge education. Artificial intelligence is already having an impact on society, helping to grow the economy and deliver better public services. In education, the technology has huge potential ranging from supporting teachers with administrative tasks to providing personalised feedback for students on their work. In a bid to unlock these benefits, the Department for Education, in collaboration with Faculty AI, the National Institute of Teaching, and the AI in Schools Initiative, is set to host an AI hackathon in London on 30 and 31 of October which will bring together teachers and leaders from schools and trusts across England, including Harris Federation, Star Academies, Outwood Grange Academies Trust and Inspiration Trust. Participants will be asked to experiment with AI to test its potential in several scenarios, for example whether it could write a lesson plan or accurately mark exam papers. Secondary school pupils will also be invited to share their experiences and knowledge. The best of the solutions will be shared with the department s workload reduction taskforce and a demo of the tools created will be made available for schools across the country to test and to use, supporting the government s ambition to reduce working hours for teachers and leaders by five hours per week. Education Secretary, Gillian Keegan, said: During my career in the tech business, I have seen innovation in action. Artificial intelligence has huge potential to transform the way we do things, from providing personalised support for pupils to helping tackle teacher workload. But to reap the benefits in education, we need to improve our understanding of how AI works and safely. Participants of the hackathons will be supported by Faculty AI and the National Institute of Teaching to experiment and put forward solutions, paving the way for the future. Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, Michelle Donelan said: This hackathon will help explore how AI can be harnessed to revolutionise education. We want to see teachers using AI to speed up administrative tasks and planning so that they are free to focus on the things which make the biggest difference to students. We are also equipping the next generation with the AI skills they need for the future, with our AI conversion courses helping students gain technical knowledge in this transformative technology so they can compete and thrive in the workplace. Tom Nixon, Director of Government at Faculty AI, said: Artificial intelligence is the defining technology of our generation - and now is the time to safely bring its vast benefits to schools. From creating timetables and lesson resources, to supporting students with personalised feedback, AI has the power to cut workloads and improve young people s education. The hackathon will be an important step in moving from rhetoric to reality, and we re excited to help get these tools into classrooms. Dr Calum Davey, Executive Director of Research at the National Institute of Teaching said: We want to see a school system that nurtures the teachers and school leaders who are making a difference for children every day. Emerging AI technology may help with their work, but if it s going to be useful and have an impact then schools need to lead identification of problems and development of solutions. We are proud to work with Faculty to connect the experts in AI technology with the experts in the classroom. Our researchers will be listening to those involved and sharing what we learn. The UK is already a world leader in AI, spearheading the safe and responsible development of the technology. Ahead of the UK AI Safety Summit on 1 and 2 November, this work will mark an important step in ensuring the UK remains at the forefront of AI globally. As part of its work in this space, the Department for Education launched acall for evidencein June to gather views from educational professionals on risks, ethical considerations, and possibilities of AI in education. The results of the call for evidence will be published in November 2023 and alongside the results from this month s hackathons, will support the government s work to identify AI s potential and ensure it advances in a safe, reasonable, and fair way.

16,59,16_pay_strb_teachers_government,"['pay', 'strb', 'teachers', 'government', 'rise', 'cent', 'said', 'year', 'pay rise', 'body']","['Teachers will get a 4 per cent pay rise next year after the government accepted the review body s recommendation, with additional funding of 615 million coming to schools. However, government has said schools will still have to fund around a quarter of the rise themselves which equates to finding 400 million from their own budgets. This comes on top of savings they have already budgeted for. Education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the pay award backed by major investment recognises the crucial role teachers play in breaking the link between background and success . But unions said they were still concerned about whether schools could afford to make savings. In its evidence to the School Teachers Review Body last year, the government said a2.8 per cent pay rise from September 2025 would be appropriate . But this has been bumped up today after the School Teachers Review Body recommended pay should rise 4 per cent. The STRB said a 2.8 per cent pay rise risked undermining improved supply, including the additional 6,500 teachers the government has committed to recruiting . Last year, the government said schools could afford 1.3 percentage points of the proposed 2.8 per cent pay rise by using 400 million of headroom in their budgets. Schools were facing finding the remaining 1.5 percentage points by making budget savings of around 525 million. Now, the government is saying that the 400 million of headroom in budgets, plus the 615 million of extra funding, will allow schools to fund 3 percentage points of the 4 per cent rise. That will leave schools having to find savings of than 350 million to cover the teacher pay rise. Including the 3.2 per cent pay rises for support staff, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates school will need to find savings of 400 million. In awritten statement to Parliament, Phillipson said she is asking schools and colleges to do their part in ensuring that we are driving productivity across all areas of the public sector . Schools will be expected to find approximately the first 1 per cent of pay awards through improved productivity and smarter spending to make every pound count. There will be those who say this cannot be done, but I believe schools have a responsibility, like the rest of the public sector, to ensure that their funding is spent as efficiently as possible. According to Phillipson, starting salaries outside London will rise to 33,000, and average salaries to over 51,000 from September. But Luke Sibieta, from the IfS, said given the pay offer is only just above inflation, the real-terms cuts to most teacher salaries since 2010 still remain in place . Teacher salaries will be about 8 per cent lower in real-times than in 2010, he added. Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said as the pay award is not fully funded , it would mean cuts in service provision to children and young people, job losses, and additional workloads for an already overstretched profession . He added that unless the government commit to fully funding the pay rise then it is likely that the NEU will register a dispute with the government on the issue of funding . Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT leaders union, said heads were rightly concerned about the affordability of this year s pay uplift . Government said it will support leaders to get best value from their funding including offering schools a suite of productivity initiatives to help them slash the costs on things like energy, banking and recruitment so every penny is invested on delivering opportunities for young people . But Pepe Di Iasio, general secretary of the ASCL leaders union, added if the government really thinks it will be possible to bridge this funding gap through improved productivity and smarter spending then it is mistaken. Schools have already spent many years cutting costs to the bone and beyond. Phillipson has also announced plans to change the rules on teaching and learning responsibility TLR payments so that for part-time staff, they must be based on the proportion of responsibility undertaken, rather than pro-rated based on contracted hours. The payments are made by schools for additional leadership and management responsibilities undertaken by classroom teachers. The current school teachers pay and conditions document states that, where TLRs are awarded to part-time teachers they must be paid pro rata at the same proportion as the teacher s part-time contract . Phillipson said this would change for all schools from 2026, and schools have the option of implementing this change from September 2025 . She added that teachers pay and conditions would also be updated to reference that employers should aim to support flexible working requests where operationally feasible . Today s announcement has also prompted a row over support staff pay. Support staff have been offered a pay rise of 3.2 per cent by their employers. Stacey Booth, national officer at the GMB, said: School support staff are the forgotten army who look after our children, feed them and nurture them. They are shockingly badly paid and it s a scandal this pay award means they will fall even behind teachers. Our members demand parity with teachers.', 'School support staff in England have been offered a pay rise of 3.2 per cent, raising the prospect of pressure on budgets next year. Pay for council-employed school support staff is negotiated between local authorities referred to as the national employers and unions. The resulting rises apply to LA-maintained schools, but many academy trusts also mirror the deals reached. This week the national employerssaid their offerwould mean the pay of the lowest-paid workers those earning 23,656 has risen by than 6,000, or 33 per cent, since April 2021. They have also offered to delete the bottom pay point from the national pay spine from next April. However, 3.2 per cent is lower than the predicted growth in wages across the wider economy. The Office for Budget Responsibility this year revised up its prediction to 3.7 per cent. The rise is higher, however, than what is proposed for teachers. In its evidence to the School Teachers Review Body last year, the Department for Education said a 2.8 per cent pay rise would be appropriate for 2025-26. The government has said it expects extra funding of 1.3 billion allocated last year to cover some of next year s pay rises, with the rest coming from efficiencies . The proposed pay rise will also put pressure on schools. The government sown analysis states schools will only be able to afford pay rises of about 1.3 per centfrom their existing headroom, with the rest of the cost having to be met by cuts. James Lewis, the leader of Leeds council and chair of the national employers said they were acutely aware of the additional pressure the offer would place on finances. However, they believe their offer is fair to employees, given the wider economic backdrop. Unions had called for an increase of at least 3,000 across all pay points, along with a clear plan to reach a minimum pay rate of 15 an hour . They also demanded one extra day of annual leave for all staff, a reduction in the working week by two hours, with no loss of pay and the ability for school staff to take at least one day of their annual leave during term time. Unison s head of local government Mike Short said: With household bills still rising, council and school staff need a decent pay award after years of below-inflation deals and deep cuts to local government services. It s vital central government also plays its part through sustained investment in local authorities. Unison will meet to discuss the offer in early May before deciding next steps. Kevin Brandstatter, GMB national officer, said local government workers deserve a proper pay rise after years of real terms wage cuts. GMB will now meet with members to discuss next steps. Pepe Di Iasio, general secretary of the ASCL leaders union, said support staff play a vital role in the running of schools and colleges and deserve to be paid fairly for the work that they do. However, we are deeply concerned about the increasing financial pressure that schools and colleges are facing. The education select committee has previously called for support staff pay rises to be factored into school budgets, and until this happens any pay awards will continue to stretch school finances. It is just not sustainable to continue in this manner. Paul Whiteman, leader of the NAHT union, said: All staff working in schools, from our own members to their valued support staff, deserve to be paid fairly. It s important school leaders receive the funding needed to cover any pay uplift, with budgets already severely stretched in many cases. NAHT represents school business leaders whose salaries are governed by this award, and we believe that their pay and conditions should be aligned with a revised leadership pay range.', 'The government has said a 2.8 per centteacher pay rise would be appropriate for 2025-26. In itsevidence to the School Teachers Review Body, the Department for Education said this level of award would maintain the competitiveness of teachers pay, despite the challenging financial backdrop the government is facing . It comes after teachers were awarded a rise of 5.5 per cent this year and 6.5 per cent last year. The government said the proposed 2.8 per cent rise would mean pay had risen by 21 per cent in four years. However, the proposal is still likely to go down badly with unions, which have pushed for pay to be restored to 2010 levels in real-terms. The IfShas estimated that even after this year s pay rise, pay of experienced teachers will be around 9 per cent lower in real-terms than in 2010, with earlier career teachers less affected because of recent large increases to starting salaries. CPI inflation rose by 2.3 per cent in the 12 months to October 2024. Unions are also likely to be unhappy that the government has told the STRB what rise it deems appropriate . The body is supposed to be independent of government, and leaders have previously warned ministers against trying to constrain its work. In her remit letter to the STRB, published in September, education secretary Bridget Phillipson urged the body to consider the cost pressures that schools are already facing and may face over the year and how they affect individual schools . At the budget in October, the DfE said that 1.3 billion of additional funding for schools for 2025-26, as well as continuing to fund the impact of this year s pay award, would also have to go towards next year s rise too. In its evidence to the STRB, the DfE said: To cover the 2.8 per cent award proposed for teachers, the department recognises that most schools will need to supplement the new funding they receive in financial year 2025-26 with efficiencies. The balance between cost increases covered by new funding and those covered through efficiencies in existing budgets will vary at an individual school level, depending on a school s circumstances for example, changes to its pupil numbers and previous spending decisions which will determine, for example, the balance between spending on teachers, support staff and non-staff . Schools will also want to factor in the impact of a 2025-26 pay award for support staff on their budgets . Any pay award assumptions which exceed what is affordable for a school overall will need to be covered through efficiencies. This includes steps necessary to achieve the proposed pay award for teachers. Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said the proposed unfunded 2.8 per cent pay increase fell well short of the urgent action needed. When the secretary of state took office, she rightly committed to securing the best life chances for every child and to recruiting 6,500 new teachers. However, neither objective can be achieved without properly investing in our education service and in the teachers who deliver it. A 2.8 per cent increase is likely to be below inflation and behind wage increases in the wider economy. This will only deepen the crisis in education. He pointed out NEU members fought to win the pay increases of 2023 and 2024 . We are putting the government on notice. Our members care deeply about education and feel the depth of the crisis. This won t do. Paul Whiteman, leader of the NAHT, warned school leaders will be particularly worried that the DfE is suggesting that this underwhelming proposal will not be funded . This would inevitably push already-stretched budgets to breaking point, forcing headteachers into really unpalatable decisions. We now look to the STRB to analyse all the evidence and assert its independence. Pepe Di Iasio, general secretary of the ASCL leaders union, called it an extremely disappointing submission from the secretary of state to the pay review body. The pay award that she proposes will not be sufficient to reverse years of pay erosion, make teaching salaries suitably competitive, and address severe teacher shortages across the country. He added that the inadequacy of the proposed pay award is compounded by the government s intention that schools should foot the bill out of their existing allocations. Given that per-pupil funding will increase on average by less than 1 per cent next year, and the government s proposal is for an unfunded 2.8 per cent pay award, it is obvious that this is in fact an announcement of school cuts. He said the STRB should assert its independence once again by making a recommendation on teacher pay sufficient to address the recruitment and retention crisis and ensure that staff are fairly remunerated for their superb and important work . Although most schools will need to find savings, the DfE said they were not alone in their efforts to better manage their spending . The department will be developing a suite of productivity initiatives , including commercial support to provide schools with access to the department s energy contracts. When schools energy contracts are up for renewal, they can join the Department s contract. This is already being piloted. schools involved in the pilot will save 36 per cent on average compared to their previous contracts. The department will also explore a number of other initiatives including plans to secure better banking solutions for schools which would result in securing better interest rates for their savings and current accounts , and the creation of Departmental goods and services deals for IT and spend on areas other than technology . This is a breaking news story and will be updated.']",Teachers’ pay review and STRB

Meanwhile MacAlister, who led a review of children s social care under the Conservative government, said it is an enormous privelege to join the DfE. It s a responsibility I take on with voices of many children and families ringing in my ears, he said on LinkedIn.He is looking forward to delivering big and positive change for the most vulnerable children in England .Bailey, who like MacAlister was made an MP in the 2024 general election, has been chair of the Labour Women s Network and deputy general secretary of the Fabian Society. She was also a senior aide to Starmer before standing as an MP and a partner at consultants Public First. Bailey had been Chair of theLabour Women s Network, deputy General Secretary of theFabian Society, and a senior aide toKeir Starmer, before standing as a parliamentary candidate. The government announced this week that Baroness Smith, who has been piloting the bill through the upper house, would serve in a new beefed-up Department for Work and Pensions, but would remain a DfE minister. Downing Street also kept Phillipson in post, despite making many changes to the cabinet following the resignation of deputy prime minister Angela Rayner.']",Education ministers and political leadership

In the spirit of collaboration, we provide an independent and neutral space for stakeholders to help shape the future of education. This is a critical year for the FED as we strengthen our case for longer-term planning in education, refine our thinking around the mechanisms we propose for wider stakeholder voices in education planning and longer-term policy making, and we work to amplify our voice to raise the issue of education higher up the political agenda. The FED is currently recruiting members to their Practitioners Council. The role of this council is to learn from those who work directly with children and young people whether in a formalised school or college setting or in informal or alternate education provisions or services. Co-Chairs of the FED Practitioners Council, Dr Jess Mahdavi-Gladwell and Dr Kate Bridge, reflect on their involvement Dr Kate Bridge Co-Chair of the Practitioners council, Physics Teacher, Mum, Runner I was encouraged to join the council by Lisa-Marie Muller from the Chartered College of teaching, and I have not regretted taking part one bit. As a council we provide an important voice of those on the coalface of education what is really going on in schools; the moments of wonderment in our teaching and the challenges faced by ourselves and our learners. Hearing from others in the different parts of the sector has been awe inspiring in terms of the difference that each of us makes; this process allows you to cheer on education practitioners and helps you reflect on your own practice. By taking part in the council my eyes have been open to not only the different types of practitioners but also how other stakeholders interact with education. I truly believe it is the together approach that FED is developing that will make our future brighter for all. On a personal note, it gives me hope that my own children, nieces and nephews might get a better deal in our system by the work I am part of now. I am so excited about what we have planned this year for the council. Working with Jess was an absolute pleasure, and I am looking forward to collaborations when we can. Plus I am excited to work with a new co-chair. Dr Jess Mahdavi-Gladwell I have stepped down from my role as co-chair of the FED Practitioners Council due to a new deputy head job which left me feeling that the role needed to be filled by someone who could genuinely identify as a practitioner and so bring that perspective to the Council. Though I am thoroughly enjoying my new role, one of the things I m sad to leave behind is the Practitioners Council. The time I spent in role was developmental and challenging as well as incredibly interesting. I was privileged to meet with a varied group of colleagues working in different settings and roles. Their perspectives and experiences, together, created a productive and reflective space where people shared knowledge and professional vulnerability to think together about how we, the people in the classroom, can contribute to a shared vision for the future of education. Taking space to envisage education, somewhat sheltered from the winds of political change allowed for creative thinking and renewed hope that things could be better, for children and for those who work in schools. There were some highlights outside of the meetings, opportunities to attend exciting events and new friendships are examples of these. The most rewarding aspect, however, was listening to the views of groups full of talented, committed teachers and other colleagues and to learn about how their settings work impacted on their vision of a long-term plan for education. These meetings provided professional learning and networking opportunities and, as I leave this group, I have joined the council for those who work in Alternative and SEND provisions so that I can continue to contribute to and benefit from being a part of FED. To this end, the Foundation for Education Development welcomes the inputs from all teachers, middle leaders, classroom assistants, pastoral managers, youth workers, probation workers, hospital education providers, etc. Because the FED is invested in improving the education system for ALL learners we welcome practitioners who support young people whatever their education pathway, including those who provide extra support to the most vulnerable. The council will meet regularly throughout the year online . Your commitment as a member is to attend a minimum of three of the six consultation sessions we will host this year. Each session lasts 90 minutes and is held on a weekday evening. If you are interested in joining this group please complete this short form by midnight Sunday 15th October. Deadline: 12am, 15 10 2023', 'We are delighted to be able to put a spotlight on Victor Sosanya. Victor, a member of the FED Learners Council, shares his reflections and involvement with the Foundation for Education Development and their journey to date. Our stakeholder councils play a pivotal role in our thinking as we develop the systems and strategies that support a long-term vision and plan for education. Hello, I m Victor Sosanya, currently pursuing a Masters in Entrepreneurship MSt at the University of Cambridge. My educational journey began in East London, leading me to study Economics at the University of Warwick. Upon graduation, I proudly earned the title of Global Undergraduate Winner 2022 in the Economics category for my published research paper, instilling in me the confidence to fuse my passion for enterprise with education at Cambridge. My educational journey from East London to the University of Cambridge is an unconventional one, shaped by overcoming setbacks and embracing entrepreneurial spirit. Failing my 11 tests shattered my mother s dreams of me attending a grammar school. I was disheartened by formal classroom learning, So I turned to business, igniting my entrepreneurial spirit in secondary school. Waking up at 5 AM to make chicken wraps became my routine, selling them at school early to fellow students and raking in over 150 every week. This income fuelled my passion project, Young Gifted Clothing, a clothing brand I started at the tender age of 14. However, my entrepreneurial pursuits led to challenges in school, with disciplinary issues arising due to a lack of focus in the classroom. Despite being academically capable, I realised that unlocking my full potential required a shift in my approach. Recognising the transformative power of education, I dedicated myself to rigorous study for my GCSE exams, resulting in an impressive achievement of 7 A s and 1 A. This academic success paved the way for me to secure a place at a top sixth form, where I excelled in Mathematics, Economics, and Biology, achieving 3 A s at A-level. I was awarded a full-tuition scholarship to the University of Warwick, endorsed by the prestigious Swiss multinational investment bank Credit Suisse as part of the Steps to Success Programme. It was at this moment I realised the power education can have in opening doors and creating opportunities. So, it awoken my desire to influence and improve education, ensuring that learners have the best chance to fulfil their academic potential and develop into well-rounded adults. Therefore, in the early years of my university experience, I made a pivotal decision to join the FED Learners Council in 2021. The council brings together diverse learners from various backgrounds to discuss and evaluate the UK education system. Our goal is to assess the curriculum s robustness, the relevance of learning styles, and the adequacy of support for current students, all with the aim of contributing to a new, long-term education policy in the UK. My initial engagement with the FED involved participating in online learner stakeholder council meetings, chaired by Mohammed and Claire. These sessions provided a platform to connect with fellow students, share experiences, and actively contribute as consultants. One standout opportunity was influencing Ofsted s new 5-year strategy during a call, where we addressed challenges facing young learners and proposed future improvements. In the meeting, concerns were raised about potential division and alienation caused by creating gifted and talented groups among pupils. This prompted a shift in focus towards advocating for a holistic education approach, valuing individuals and encouraging a broader range of extra-curricular subjects. Anna Trethewey, Head of Strategy at Ofsted, acknowledged our contributions and included in the strategy. Furthermore, my role as a FED Learner Council member presented the exciting opportunity to participate in an Education Roundtable at No.10 Downing Street. Here, we focused on ensuring young people s agency and voice in shaping the education planning framework for the UK. Advising Rory Gribbell, then Senior Policy Adviser to the PM and now Lead Adviser at Ofsted, provided valuable experience in reasoning with senior leaders and crafting practical solutions, enhancing my problem-solving skills. We stressed the importance of genuine accountability and feedback groups, rejecting tokenistic approaches. Also, encouraging that young people voices are genuinely heard and listened to. This opportunity not only expanded my network but also garnered recognition, leading to invitations for consultations and events. I was invited to Santander s Chairman s Annual Drinks Reception by the FED which exposed me to senior stakeholders promoting enterprise, skills, and careers for young people. This experience highlighted that education extends beyond exams, emphasising individual development. Being part of the Learners Council had a direct impact on me, uncovering my passion for enterprise and career development. This passion led to my selection to represent the FED on a panel alongside Dr Rania Marandos and Dr Anne Bamford at a Skills Conference hosted at Guildhall, City of London. I discussed the importance of skills development and the implementation of fusion skills in the education curriculum. The FED continued to provide rare opportunities, including an invitation to Windsor Castle for a 2-day consultation in partnership with The Brookings Institution with global education leaders. Hosting a panel during this event, alongside Charlie Radman, Global Education Technology Leader at HP, made me realise the transformative potential of tech and entrepreneurial thinking. This realisation influenced my decision to formally study Entrepreneurship MSt at Cambridge Judge Business School. Moreover, I was also featured in the FED Educational Consultation Report 2023. Most recently, I had the honour of representing the FED Learners Council at the annual ambassador meeting at the Athenaeum Club. I was responsible for showcasing our collective work and impact. At the Athenaeum Club, I had the privilege of meeting Chris Outram, Founder of OC C Strategy Consultants, Trustee of United World Schools, and current Board Member of UCL Global Business School for Health. We talked on a lot of topics, including building a business, running a charity and other thought-provoking subjects. This initial encounter evolved into online Zoom calls with Chris, where he generously shared his valuable insights. Being part of the FED Learners Council has not only facilitated my individual and academic development but has inspired a continuous pursuit of learning, expanded my professional network, and provided opportunities for personal growth. In summary, the FED Learners Council is the ideal platform for young learners aspiring to influence change in education while undergoing a transformative personal journey.', 'The Foundation for Education Development FED are delighted to share this thinkpiece by Tom Clark CBE, Dame Kathy August and Tony Mackay Centre for Strategic Education, Melbourne, Australia . On reading this they ask to consider the following Please note we invite a bi-partisan approach. We want the core of good education policy to be jointly owned by Government, the profession, the stakeholders and the public a cause for the common good. Education in England needs a re-set a practitioners view and a call for action In another 50 years time researchers of educational history will be hard pressed to decide which period of the last 50 years turned out to be the most productive in terms of translating political intent to an effective reality. Which will be the set of policies that the evidence shows succeeded or even approached England achieving a first class public education service? The scope and reach of AI that until relatively recently seemed to be futurology is already beginning to be felt. A world class public education system needs to be informed by a strategic appreciation of the ways in which learners can benefit from new technologies and the impact they will have on their lives and their learning. However, the current direction of travel in education seems counter- productive. The present route map is of a manufactured division of traditional versus progressive mindsets. Too often the status of expert is awarded to those who have simply established themselves as education influencers with strong political links but with little substantive evidence of impact. Theories are promoted without an appreciation of the need for effective implementation, and there is an increasing over reliance on ever stricter disciplines in order to make schooling accept a stale orthodoxy, a groupthink , which worryingly expects compliance whilst dismissing challenge. There is an awareness of the large gaps in achievement, particularly for boys in disadvantaged areas; of a lack of trust in our leaders and law-makers; and the overwhelming fear and lack of agency felt by communities. Postpandemic recruitment and retention in education is severely compromised and there is evidence of school leaders choosing to retire early. A re-set is needed one in which public education acknowledges present failings and the need for a new vision of the future. The backdrop to this is one of wider global societal change accelerated by the pandemic and the pace of technological advance. Geo-politically, in different parts of the world, traditional judgements are being challenged including those relating to capitalism, Western democratic values and authoritarianism with the risk of social fragmentation being very high. Having worked in education at senior executive levels since the 1988 Education Act and been in the vanguard of change throughout the intervening period we believe a re-set of priorities is needed. As long-serving Headteachers, our work was recognised nationally but the culture then was much less risk-averse. Compliance was not an end in itself and Government and regulatory bodies, though ever-ready to tell Headteachers what to do, were much less likely to tell Headteachers how to do things. School leaders were the leading professionals. The landscape today is one where there has been a serious shift to the DfE of a controlling power which neither encourages nor enables the professional engagement of school leaders. This has to change as society has had to change in what may become a paradigm shift. We want to encourage a view that re-imagining and re-setting the education system as a whole in England is necessary by developing, disseminating and advocating new thinking the direction of travel for a new age of education and we want to remind all stakeholders that they have the expertise and the capacity to help lead this process. This is a collective challenge which includes government, indeed releases government to enable and broker a re-set rather than focusing on regulation. Any re-set has to have a systematised design within which leaders can lead and needs an agreed long-term plan with a shared vision of education which includes business. A strong economy needs a strong education service. Why now? Education in England needs re-imagining because of years of increasingly chaotic government, the self-infliction of grade inflation , questionable changes, and likely disruption to teacher training and present funding issues which highlight that the system is simply not fit for purpose for young people and new societal demands. The system needs re-purposing and a new design. The perpetual lag between education and the societal and technological changes affecting it has grown and it is now approaching a chasm. The policy response has been to double down on increasing centralisation and consequent direction. As a result children and young people in state education are becoming and disconnected. Meanwhile the economic costs of such alienation grow exponentially. Change is needed not in structures but in terms of purpose, objectives and method. There has been an incoherent and inefficient waste of resources which has compromised future thinking and practice. It s not just about the size of the resource it s about how it is used. Too much of the thinking of the past has concentrated on the what and the how with too much focus on structures rather than remembering what education is for, the why , the purpose and what metrics we should use to value young people and their learning made urgent in England by the recent devaluation of the currency of qualifications. However inconvenient, and despite the noise of the media and the distractions of social media, we must acknowledge that the culture of permanent risk avoidance and routine compliance to an Orwellian-like group- speak of a new orthodoxy and its establishment of vested interests, is stifling professional initiative and creating homogenised learning. The effect of this rigidity is not recognised for what it is or does to undermine and dissipate the confidence of school leaders and other stakeholders. It strangles the very innovation and creativity which the country, the economy and the sector requires. We already have a one world economy of instant communications, internet learning, networks and virtual communities, with the accelerated flows associated with geopolitics, economics, communications and business, in an already fundamentally changing world. As globalization and rapid advancements in technology continue to transform civic space and the world of work, education systems have grown increasingly disconnected from the realities and needs of global economies and societies. Education models must adapt to prepare young people for personal growth, life and work in a global society by radically reconsidering its purpose, culture and operation. The digital age is already transforming the corporate world. Schools and Colleges have to catch up now. World Economic Forum January 2020 This 4th Industrial Revolution is causing a seismic shift in all aspects of life, where, in a cyber world of AI and machine learning, we need to protect a space for humans in which they can flourish. The future is not what it used to be it is already here. We are not the only voices Of course there is widespread thinking and activity in the UK and abroad, in particular in Singapore, Hong Kong, British Columbia, and Estonia. We value the work streams of the UK Foundation for Education Development, the report of The Times Education Commission, The OECD paper Building the Future of Education , statements from The Centre for Global Development and the United Nations each in consideration of the need to transform education. These initiatives have their own integrity but are rather piecemeal. However to meet a collective challenge we need to come together. The challenge We need to 1. Agree that pedagogy is the professional practice which ensures that the curriculum as intended is enacted and should lead the learning process. Structures should come later to enable the design not limit it 2. Challenge in real time the comfortable Westminster metropolitan belief of how education looks and works across all the regions of the UK 3. Widen the metrics by which we value young people beyond SATs, GCSE, and A level recognising that changing the metrics changes the curriculum and ways of learning and that resourcefulness, independence of thought, communication skills, initiative, global citizenship, digital skills and entrepreneurship should be valued 4. Re-imagine Teacher Education and Training its structure and content in order for teachers to become experts in learning and pedagogy 5. Highlight that technology can be used to facilitate wider learning, different types of learning and learning opportunities 24 7, 365 days a year, led by pedagogy which acknowledges a new blend of face-to-face, virtual and collaborative learning such that the education service becomes a process than a location. Sadly, so far the use of on-line technology seems rather to have been used for administrative purposes rather than to enhance the learning experience, too much of on-line learning attempts to replicate but not develop classroom experience 6. Re-imagine and re-value vocational and digital education helping eliminate the elite education snobbery that undermines developing vocational skills and apprenticeships 7. Demand, expect and ensure transparency in the accountability of Universities and urge them to provide flexible 2 year undergraduate courses with a mix of residential, face to face, and remote learning which doesn t drain local communities of too many of their best and brightest who take up university residence but few of whom return home after graduation 8. Recognise that on balance in their work regulatory bodies like Ofsted should report rather than evaluate their findings 9. Underpin any changes by a forensic consideration of governance, finance and learning out comes in all education institutions. How should things look? Some of the desirable changes might see 1. Schools at the heart of public services with data sharing protocols processed through shared admin hubs. Access to all professionals being enabled via AI in real time through education channels but stopping the over reliance on the school system to provide social control. Schools make an important contribution but cannot underpin the whole of society 2. All the learning of students being valued Global learning resources developed and shared on line on-line 3. Curricula developed both vertically for subjects for depth but also horizontally for the development of skills 4. Teacher- pupil relationships reimagined emphasising a tutorial model for learning 5. Many school buildings which are too small and simply no longer fit for purpose are closed or linked virtually 6. Some retained or new buildings become local and regional state of the art hubs for science and technology, sport, the arts, and social interaction and development, open all day every day complementing the standard school provision of subjects like history, english, and geography 7. Greater system leadership demonstrated by practitioners embracing the digital future 8. focused and efficient use of resources Reduced student costs in fees and charges for residency 9. Term times an anachronism largely based on the 19th Century farming calendar are scrapped. Better educated people and wealth creators in the global economy The challenges are huge but not insurmountable and resolution is cultural as well as technical and political. Civil society rests on moral relationships . They are not brought about by government but by us Jonathan Sachs but we recognise only government can enable a re-set . To be enacted a collective challenge requires system-wide recognition and a collective responsibility to resolve issues seen as a public duty. The shape of education now and the future could benefit from Sydney Newman s advice to look back not in anger nor forward in fear but around with awareness to which we might add but with energy and resolve .

But Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole BCP council said itwould have to declare effective bankruptcythis year if its soaring dedicated schools grant DSG blackhole is not resolved. It is one of five new councils in talks with the government over agreeing a safety valve bailout to help bring down their deficit which is now expected to reach a cumulative 63.4 million by March this year. Launched in 2021, the 1 billion programme sees 34 councils make sweeping reforms in exchange for government bailouts. However, they come with strict cost-saving measures attached. But BCP said one of the proposals risks an inability to deliver all aspects of the plan due to legality essentially meaning it would be forced to break its legal duties for provision relating to SEND children to cut costs. The council has instead put forward its own plan to bring down the deficit over 15 years, as opposed to the usual five required by government. One of the proposals includes the council transferring 11 per cent from its mainstream schools budgets into the high needs pot, which would require ministerial approval. The figure could rise to 16 per cent in some schools and is due to be discussed by the council s schools forum on Monday. However, a spokesperson for the BCP primary headteachers group toldSchools Weekthe proposals are simply frightening . The transfer would leave schools in a perilous and in some cases untenable position, with most requiring redundancies of key staff . They added this was all at a time when being asked to support ever-increasing numbers of children with complex needs and statutory education, health and care plans EHCPs . Far from being a safety valve , it currently seems to headteachers that this proposal poses a serious risk to the short- and long-term future of BCP schools and to, most importantly, the young people they serve. Another proposal would include a rapid rebalancing of the deficit over five-years, but this would mean 90 per cent of new EHCPs for children with SEND had to be for mainstream schools, up from 70 per cent. However, even the Department for Education s SEND adviser agreed the plan was unrealistic , council documents state. SEND campaigner Adam Sofianos, who attended the meeting last week, described it as a disturbing insight that confirms so many fears about this project . A second potentially deliverable but very challenging plan would see the in-year deficit maintained at 27.5 million but this would result in an accumulated deficit of 198 million by 2028 29. Under this plan, the number of EHCPs issued each month would have to fall from 30 to 24 by 2030 31. The council s 15-year plan is based on this second scenario. But Cllr Richard Burton, BCP education lead, said this is very unlikely to be acceptable to the DfE, which is due to respond to the proposals this month. BCP has been part of the delivering better value in SEND programme for the past year a government scheme where councils with less severe deficits get expert support to make savings. But a September council report said: Consultants working with us have been unable to establish how an in-year balance of the high needs block can be achieved. The council, controlled by a Liberal Democrat-led alliance since May, has also warned when the so-called statutory override ends in March 2026, it may have to effectively declare bankruptcy. Since 2020, the government has allowed DSG deficits to sit off council books. Schools Weekrevealed last year that nearly a dozen councils would have had to issue section 114 notices if the override ended as planned in 2022. Instead, it was extended until 2026. But a BCP council report stated it expects to issue a bankruptcy notice in December this year if the override is not extended again. Bracknell Forest and Cheshire East, also in safety valve negotiations, have both said similar. Last month, local government minister Simon Hoare told MPs his department, DfE and the Treasury are working together to prepare for the end of the ring fence, to avoid jeopardising local authorities financial viability . But he added some local authorities can and should be doing to manage their systems well and sustainably . Sir David Davis, the veteran Conservative MP,warned the Commons yesterday that, when the override expires, many councils will be bankrupted overnight, with huge implications not just for education but for all local services . He said the f40 council group said it is a sword of Damocles hanging over the entire sector . Cllr Alex Dale, f40 spokesperson, called for the override to be extended, followed by extra funding and resources. Labour s shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson toldSchools Weekthey have an election to win before they can take any decision . I think we do need to look afresh at the whole landscape and make sure that children with SEND are getting the support that they need. A DfE spokesperson said they are supporting councils to effectively and sustainably manage their high needs systems . Devon and Wiltshire are also in safety valve talks.', 'than a third of councils with safety-valve deals to plug high-needs deficits face bankruptcy, despite being set to receive than 1 billion in government bailouts before the end of the decade. Since 2021, 38 councils with eye-watering SEND deficits have had to strike deals that give them annual cash injections in return for savings plans with strings attached. In 2020 the government overrode standard accounting rules, letting councils keep dedicated schools grant DSG deficits off their general revenue books, which enabled them to set overall balanced budgets. That override is set to end in 2026, after which it was hoped councils would have eradicated these deficits. But than a third 38 per cent of the 28 safety-valve councils that responded to a freedom of request admitted they were at risk of issuing a section 114 notice meaning they could not balance their budgets in the next three years. This was partly driven by the escalating cost of SEND provision. Section 114s restrict council spending to the statutory minimum, forcing curbs to SEND services. Stoke-on-Trent said it was facing a risk of section 114 due to pressures and demands across all of children s services . It was not on track to balance its DSG deficit by 2025, as agreed in its safety-valve deal, with its officers in constant dialogue with the DfE . North Tyneside s risk of not being able to ensure financial sustainability without raiding reserves is currently flagged as an A1 risk with very high likelihood . However, the authority said this did not mean that it expected to issue a section 114 notice between now and 2028. Bath and North East Somerset isone of five councilswhose safety-valve deals are currently subject to review after it failed to hit spending targets. The authority joined the programme in 2022-23, securing a deal for 19.2 million but after overspending in its high-needs block by 9.3 million in 2023-24, grant payments have been suspended , council papers said. Scott Gardner, senior SEND accountant for Achieving for Children, which runs Richmond s children s services, said it had been highlighted by the DfE as a success of the safety valve programme . However if the funding ceases there is a high risk that within five years the borough will be in the same financial position it was before it was introduced. Dorset is making progress , but this has not yet translated into financial savings or efficiencies . The council expected to end the 2022-23 financial year with a 10.4 million high-needs deficit, but it almost doubled to 19.7 million. In March 2024 its 24 million deficit was than triple a predicted 7 million. Council officers recently met with DfE colleagues to find a way forward . Bristol s DSG deficit rose to 58.6 million at the end of 2023-24. It received only 21.5 million in safety-valve funding from the DfE to offset this, leaving it carrying over a 37.1 million deficit into this year. Steven Peacock, its chief executive, warned recently of the SEND bailout: If we get this wrong, we ll be effectively bankrupt. Councils are also missing their targets to reduce EHCPs under the agreements, as demand for SEND support soars. families are also objecting to council decisions. In 2022-23 the number of SEN appeal outcomes rose by a third to 12,000, of which 8,000 were decided by tribunal. Ninety-eight per cent of tribunals found in favour of families, up two percentage points on the year before. A third of the responding safety-valve councils said the risk of them not being able to deliver their statutory duties for SEND children had risen in the previous year, with a quarter saying it had remained unchanged. All but one of Bath and North East Somerset s three special schools and six resource bases are full or oversubscribed . It has struggled to meet its statutory duties and had to rely on expensive out of area placements . A new SEND advice service the council is launching in September will aim to reduce EHCPs and to focus on data . Councils are also being hampered by disorganised commissioning of SEND services. In the 32 Ofsted areaSEND inspectionssince January 2023, almost a third were graded 3 with systematic failings , another third 1 typically positive , while almost half were 2 inconsistent . Catriona Moore, policy manager at the Independent Provider of Special Education Advice, warned recently that safety-valve councils targets, which include reducing EHC needs assessments, risk councils exposing themselves to legal challenges than ever .', 'Councils have been given ministerial approval to seize than 82 million funding from their mainstream schools to prop up widening SEND deficits. The approval is thought to be for the highest amount ever and comes despite many leaders refusing to back the raid. Schools in one area, South Gloucestershire, said it left them contemplating potentially shocking cuts such as breaching class sizes and appointing apprentices, instead of qualified teachers. Hillingdon schools said planned cuts would have amounted to 50,000 each the equivalent of employing a teacher. Meanwhile in Essex, a leader said the devastating raid would result in inclusion jobs and strategies being cut. It is a textbook case of robbing Peter to pay Paul and everybody loses out, said Pepe Di Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. The government must write off local authority high needs deficits, otherwise we ll never get out of this cycle. Beyond that, urgent reform is needed to create a sustainable system. Councils must get approval from the Department for Education if they want to transfer than 0.5 per cent from their core schools budget to their high-needs block, or up to 0.5 per cent without schools forum approval. Freedom of data shows 23 councils requested to top-slice funding for 2024-25. Just two were refused despite nearly half being opposed by school forums. Last year, 23 councils were givenapproval to slice 67 million. In 2020-21, just three councils weregranted no than 17 million. Kent County Council was given the green light to slice 16.5 million, the most by any council. Norfolk was allowed to plunder the highest percentage of its core schools budget at nearly 1.5 per cent, totalling 9.7 million. The government estimates that councils will have high needs deficits totalling nearly 5 billion by 2026. Currently an accounting override allows the deficits to sit off balance sheets, but this is due to end next year, with than half of councils warning of insolvency. Many councils said the cash would be used to fund early intervention work, documents show. Devon council said funding early intervention would reduce escalation to high-cost statutory processes of pupils obtaining education, health and care plans EHCPs . The council will slice 0.5 per cent from its schools budgets, totalling nearly 3 million. Barnsley, Cambridgeshire, Hillingdon and Merton all argued that the funding would help set up new state SEND provision and reduce their expenditure on costly private schools. Cambridgeshire said its dependency on private provision led to unsustainable pressures . Hillingdon will use the cash to provide exceptional funding to highly inclusive schools with above-average levels of EHCPs. Fifteen of the 23 councils that requested fund transfers are part of the government s safety valve scheme where those with the largest deficits get bailouts in exchange for severe cost-cutting. But some councils said they had no choice but to raid school budgets as bailouts were not enough. Cambridgeshire council told the government all savings that can be practically achieved had been made, but they were still see ing demand increasing above funding . North Tyneside council said it would not deliver on its cost-cutting forecast under its safety valve deal unless it top-sliced 0.5 per cent from its mainstream schools. In some cases, multi-year transfers were agreed as part of councils safety valve agreements. Bracknell Forest has a five-year plan to top slice its schools. The council s high needs deficit is currently 18 million, equivalent to 70 per cent of its year high needs income. That deficit was projected to increase to 47 million in five years than 150 per cent of income. Kent s agreement to move 1.2 per cent will run until 2028, or until such time that we achieve an in-year break-even position . The council s deficit for next year is 81 million. Essex, one of five councils not on a government SEND spending intervention scheme, will top-slice 1 per cent 12.5 million from its mainstream schools. Leaders were warned at a schools forum to think carefully about the decision to protect ourselves as schools to ensure we maintain control rather than being forced into what we should do by falling into government intervention . There are some schools with no balances at all, but within the current funding structure there is nothing anyone can do about this, the forum heard. But Rob Williams, senior policy advisor at school leaders union NAHT, said core school budgets are already under considerable pressure, and moving money around in this way is simply not sustainable . Nonetheless, the Department for Education has asked safety valve councils to cut . Officials questioned North Somerset council s decision to transfer only 0.5 per cent in 2023-24. The council ended up agreeing to 1 per cent. And officials suggested that South Gloucestershire increase its transfer this year from 2.2 million to 2.6 million. The council s schools forum agreed only to the lower amount. Last year,Schools Weekrevealed that councils had been given government approval to circumvent laws requiring minimum funding levels in schools so they could divert cash. The DfE has allowed Kent to reduce its minimum per-pupil funding again, by 0.9 per cent for the upcoming year. In Bournemouth, the government agreed to reducing the minimum limit by 1 per cent. North Tyneside is also now breaking minimum funding levels. Caroline Derbyshire, CEO of Saffron Academy Trust in Essex, which is top-slicing 1 per cent, said wider transfers could put a number of schools and trusts into a place where they are no longer going concerns next year. It s that serious. Nearly 30 million of funding was taken from budgets without schools forum approval. In North Tyneside, 89 per cent of survey respondents did not support the council s 0.5 per cent transfer. Some schools said the impact on their own finances would plunge them into deficit. Hillingdon council first proposed transferring 2.5 per cent of its mainstream schools budget. Over 90 per cent of respondents were against the plan, which amounted to roughly 50,000 per school or the cost of one teacher. Hillingdon submitted a request for a modest 1.9 per cent transfer, but this was refused by the government. Instead, it agreed to a 0.5 per cent transfer of 1.5 million. The council also discussed with the government whether it could minimise its top-slice by taking 11 million of surplus cash held by its schools. However, the process would have taken too long . In Surrey, schools forum minutes noted that some felt the transfer was punishing everyone . But a low consultation response rate might reflect a sense of inevitability about the proposal , the minutes added. But in Norfolk, the chair of the council s schools forum, Martin White, said its transfer runs counter to the logic of mainstream inclusion . Schools told the forum in November that resulting staff cuts meant they could no longer meet EHCP requirements . South Gloucestershire s schools forum agreed to transfer 2.2 million, but pleaded with the education secretary to recognise the financial challenges it faced. The council ranks last in the country for mainstream school funding and said in its application that schools were hanging on by a thread . The things they are having to do to balance budgets are potentially shocking, it said. This includes increasing class sizes above 30, recruiting apprentices instead of qualified teachers and turning off heating, leaving children and staff cold . There is nothing left to cut, the submission said, except the things children and staff need to learn and teach in a safe environment. Simon Botten, an executive headteacher in South Gloucestershire, said top-slicing cost schools on average 16,000. cuts would at best jeopardise academic progress, and at worst be dangerous . An Essex leader told their schools forum meeting they had to cull a third of my support staff last time round. The various strategies like inclusion that we have to operate in schools, they are strategies that will be cut, they added. The impact on secondary schools will be devastating and that will be passed on to our children in schools. John Winter, CEO of Weydon MAT in Surrey, said mainstream schools have reached the end of their ability to cope with any cuts . The government is working on major SEND reforms. The DfE did not respond to a request for comment. But Williams said deficits must be written off, so councils have a clean slate to enact change. Top slice councils said they were looking to find the fairest solution to a very challenging financial situation . Many said it was a temporary solution, and called on government for urgent reforms . A County Councils Network spokesperson added the financially unsustainable SEND system meant some have no choice but to ask for transfers. Arooj Shah, chair of the Local Government Association s children and young people board, said that bold and brave action is needed in the upcoming spending review to ensure councils have the required financial stability to provide SEND support.']",SEND funding pressures and council deficits

This is largely because of the time lag in the official statistics. The most recent set cover the period Autumn to Spring 2023 24. In other words, they are a year behind. Back in February, we looked atexclusions and suspensions in the Autumn termof the current academic year. This seemed to show that the rate of increase in the exclusion and suspension rates, which has been fairly sharp since the pandemic, was beginning to slow down. With data for the Spring term now in the bag, we look at whether this is still the case. Pupils who are permanently excluded or suspended but who remain on the school roll are marked as code E in registers for up to five days. From the sixth consecutive day, alternative provision is supposed to be arranged. Using attendance data for Autumn and Spring 2023 24 and 2024 25 supplied by 9,000 schools subscribing to FFT attendance tracker, we can summarise rates of absence due to exclusion and suspension for both years. What we cannot do is distinguish between spells that are due to suspension and spells that are due to exclusion or accurately, spells that will result in due course in permanent exclusion . As usual, we begin by comparing our figures with published official statistics, the most recent of which are for the Spring term 2023 24. The figures we produce are equivalent to the sum of the permanent exclusion rate and the suspension rate, in other words the total number of exclusions and suspensions divided by the total number of pupils. Given that suspensions tend to outnumber permanent exclusions by a rate of approximately 20 to 1 then our figures are mainly of suspensions. We show our calculated figures for Autumn and Spring 2023 24 alongside the published DfE figures in the chart below. This pattern is typical when we do sort of analysis. Our figures are fairly close to DfE figures but, if anything, are a bit lower, particularly for Years 8 to 10, the year groups with the highest rates. There may be various reasons for this. For example, If a pupil returns from suspension and is suspended again the same day we would count that as one suspension rather than two. Consequently, our figures for Autumn 2024 25 might be slightly under-estimated. Repeating our methodology for Autumn and Spring 2023 24 and 2024 25, we see little change in the rate of suspensions and exclusions across all year groups. Among the primary year groups, we see a small increase in the combined exclusion and suspension rate of 0.2 percentage points pps . Among secondary year groups, we see slight increases in the rate for Year 7 and Year 8 0.4pps , no change for Year 9 and decreases for Years 10 and 11 0.5pps and 0.6pps respectively . The suspension rate is the number of suspensions divided by the number of pupils so a rate of 20 does not mean that 20 of pupils have been suspended. Some pupils will be suspended than once. But we can also summarise the percentage of pupils who are suspended or excluded at least once. For most year groups, 2024 25 rates were very close to those for 2023 24 and slightly lower for pupils in Years 10 and 11. We continue to see stark differences in the percentage of disadvantaged pupils suspended or excluded at least once compared to their peers. than 14 of disadvantaged pupils in Years 9 and 10 around one in seven have been suspended or excluded at least once this year up to the end of the Spring term. Disadvantage, along with a previous history of social care and a previous history of suspension, arethe biggest risk factors of exclusion. Published DfE statistics for the 2022 23 academic year showed that suspensions reached record levels andour analysis for 2023 24suggests that they were higher still. Data for the 2024 25 academic year so far suggests that the rate of increase is at least beginning to slow. A peak may have been reached, or is close to being reached. It remains the case though that disadvantaged pupils are disproportionately far likely than other pupils to experience exclusion or suspension.

By the end of 2021 22the rate of suspensions was the highest on record since DfE moved to its present method of collecting exclusions and suspensions data via School Census. The permanent exclusion rate remains lower than in 2006 07. The data published for 2022 23 suggests that the suspension rate has risen again. We can go one better and provide some basic statistics on exclusions and suspensions for the current academic yearusing attendance data we ve collected from schoolsto gauge whether the increase in exclusions and suspensions observed in 2022 23 continued. Briefly, pupils who remain on the school roll but who have been suspended or permanently excluded are recorded in the attendance register using code E. If the exclusion is for 6 days or , alternative provision is supposed to be arranged from the 6thday. We use attendance data for the Autumn and Spring terms 2023 24 collected from almost 10,000 schools subscribing toFFT Attendance Tracker. We then identify spells of absence recorded as code E. Counting spells gives us an approximate total number of exclusions and suspensions. What we cannot do is distinguish between spells that are due to suspension and spells that are due to exclusion or accurately, spells that will result in due course in permanent exclusion . As we didlast time we did this exercise based on data for the Autumn term , we compare our exclusion statistics using attendance data with the official statistics. The figures we produce are equivalent to the sum of the permanent exclusion rate and the suspension rate, in other words the total number of exclusions and suspensions divided by the total number of pupils. We show our calculated figures for the Autumn and Spring terms 2022 23 alongside the published DfE figures in the chart below. Our figures are fairly close to DfE figures but, if anything, are a bit lower, particularly for Years 8 and 9. Consequently, our figures for 2023 24 might be something of an under-estimate. Repeating our methodology for 2023 24, we see a notable increase in suspensions and exclusions. For example, the suspension exclusion rate for Year 9 in 2022 23 stood at 16.4 . In 2023 24 it increased to 20.6 , an increase of 4.2 percentage points or a 25 increase in suspensions. For Year 7 pupils, there was a smaller absolute increase from a lower base of 2.7 percentage points but a larger relative increase a 33 increase in suspensions. The suspension rate is the number of suspensions divided by the number of pupils so a rate of 20 does not mean that 20 of pupils have been suspended. Some pupils will be suspended than once. But we can also summarise the percentage of pupils who are suspended or excluded at least once. Whereas in the previous chart the highest rate was among Year 9 pupils, this time the highest rate is among Year 10 pupils 8.2 in 2023 24 compared to 7.8 in 2022 23 . That the suspension rate is than double the rate of pupils suspended at least once implies that, on average, the mean number of suspensions per suspended pupil is above 2. It also appears to have increased compared to last year although we will leave that for another day. We also see stark differences in the percentage of disadvantaged pupils suspended or excluded at least once compared to their peers. Around 15 of disadvantaged pupils in Years 9 and 10 have been suspended or excluded at least once so far this academic year. Published DfE statistics for the Autumn and Spring terms combined 2022 23 showed an increase in exclusions and suspensions compared to the previous year. Analysis of attendance registers for the Autumn and Spring terms combined 2023 24 suggests there has been a increase this year.

We lastlooked at this at the end of the Spring Termin 2024. We now look at the full academic year 2023 24. By contrast, the most recent at the time of writing official statisticsfor exclusions and suspensions, published in July 2023, relate to the 2022 23 academic year. This is largely because data is collected, via the School Census process, two terms in arrears. This means, for example, that data for the summer term 2023 was collected in the January 2024 School Census. Although the census date is the third Thursday in January, schools have until the middle of February to submit the data. The data is then published some months later. Exclusions and suspensions data for the full 2023 24 academic year will only be published next July. However, we can get a handle on whether they have increased or not by examining absence codes from schools attendance registers. Pupils who are permanently excluded or suspended but who remain on the school roll are marked as code E in registers for up to five days.

Experts predict a sharp drop in the number of applied general qualifications, coupled with slow growth in the number of students taking their replacement T-levels will lead to one in eight sixth formers falling through the gap . First-of-their-kind projections to measure the scale of the impact ofministers controversial level 3 reformshave been released today by the Protect Student Choice campaign, in the absence of any official modelling from government. In a scathing report, the campaign also accused ministers of playing fast and loose with data by using it in a partial and misleading way to justifytheir plans. But skills minister Robert Halfon defended the plans, saying his government no longer incentivise courses like self-tanning, balloon artistry and pole fitness instructing as the last government did. We ve worked hand in glove with hundreds of employers to rebuild the entire skills system. Alternative qualifications including BTECs will continue, however, we will be removing those where there is poor uptake, inadequate outcomes, or overlap with our world-class T-levels. The DfE wants a streamlined system for students finishing their GCSEs which pushes them to study either A-levels, T Levels, or an apprenticeship from 2025. Alternative applied general qualifications AGQs like Pearson s popular BTECs will only get funding from this point if they do not overlap with the other qualifications and pass a strict approvals process. A freedom of request by the Sixth Form Colleges Association, which leads the Protect Student Choice campaign, found there were 281,260 students studying at least one level 3 AGQ in 2022-23, and 15,410 were studying a T-level. The association s report warned that AGQ numbers will fall rapidly and significantly. 191,257 students are studying qualifications that the government has already deemed to be ineligible for reapproval and will scrap by 2026. The remaining 90,003 are studying qualifications that the government will consider reapproving. The SFCA predicted that linear growth a steady increase based on the three years of student numbers available in T-level learners was the most likely trend, which would lead to 51,482 enrolments by 2026. Analysis indicates at least 155,185 students around 13 per cent of sixth formers in England are currently enrolled on an AGQ that will be scrapped and will not be able to enrol on a T-level if growth follows the SFCA s linear projection. The association said this was almost certainly a significant underestimate, as it has assumed that all applied generals eligible for reapproval will successfully navigate the reapproval process. In practice, this is extremely unlikely . Funding was made available in the 2021 spending review for up to 100,000 T Level students by 2024-25. The SFCA said achieving this number in the next two years would involve near-exponential growth. That is not consistent with enrolment patterns to date . Ministers believe that T-levels will gain traction when competing qualifications like BTECs have been removed. But the SFCA warned scrapping BTECs to drive up T-level numbers is a high risk strategy that is not supported by evidence , adding many schools and colleges predict the reforms are likely to drive up A-level numbers instead. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the report finally reveals the calamitous impact the government s reforms will have . The government should now pause and review its plans as a matter of extreme urgency. To fail to do so is to wilfully abandon the futures of a whole generation of sixth form students. A DfE spokesperson said: This September there are 18 high quality T Levels available offered at than 160 providers across the country. courses will be coming on board over the next few years, so we expect student numbers to rise as these are rolled out. Ministers also stand accused of being so desperate to boost T-level enrolments that they routinely misuse a range of measures to understate the performance of applied general qualifications and overstate the performance of T-levels. For example, qualifications like the BTEC foundation diploma in health and social care have been criticised by ministers because less than 5 per cent of students progress to higher education. What officials ignore is that 64 per of students studying this qualification progress to employment and 24 per cent to education, according to the SFCA. The association said that by contrast, ministers routinely described T-levels as gold standard qualifications that offer the best progression for students . Yet detailed performance data for T-levels will not be available until 2025 and progression data not until 2027 at the earliest. Data is currently limited to pass rates. Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said T-levels were a welcome addition to the qualifications landscape, but there is simply no data to support the government s claim that they are a gold standard improvement on BTECs . Ministers must pause and review their plan, to avoid doing serious damage to young people, social mobility and the economy.', 'Ofqual s Chair looks ahead to assessment and examination results in 2023. Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to be with you this afternoon as Chair of Ofqual. Unfortunately, the Chief Regulator is unable to be with us today, which I know she very much regrets. She spoke to your winter conference last year in remote format, but it s obviously much better to be here face to face and talk in person. And what a difference a year makes. Last year saw the very welcome return of a normal series of examinations and formal assessments, or nearly normal. Thank you for everything you did to enable those to run smoothly in your colleges. I know it wasn t always easy but we had a really good outcome for young people, nonetheless. I will be saying something later on exams this summer, but I wanted to start with what is happening on the review of level 3 qualifications, including, for example, courses like BTECs at level 3, but also the whole range of alternative academic and technical qualifications at level 3. I know that there are questions and potentially some concerns about what is happening, including the approval process for continued funding, and why all this is happening, so I thought it might be helpful for me to offer a brief overview. Aside from a small number of exceptions, all level 3 alternative academic and technical qualifications qualifications at level 3 which are not T Levels or A levels, like for example level 3 BTECS, alongside many others are being required to re-apply for funding as part of a government-led streamlining programme for these qualifications. The government s aim for this exercise is in essence threefold: firstly, to simplify the landscape, including addressing what is seen as in some cases unnecessary duplication where that exists to drive up the quality of qualifications and the assessment that underpins them and to ensure that appropriate priority is given to T Levels and their place in the landscape These alternative and technical qualifications constitute a large and complex area in comparison, say, with A levels and T Levels. For example, there are than 60 awarding organisations offering the qualifications that are in scope, and several thousand different level 3 qualifications in the alternative academic and technical space. Some of these are large entry and well known to you in your colleges, and some, of course, are very small in terms of entry, and not likely to be on your radar as college leaders. Last week the governmentpublished details of their new qualifications funding approval processfor qualifications at level 3. Talking to your colleagues, I know that that is under scrutiny by your representatives and I am sure debate will continue. What the document sets out to do is bring clarity on what type of L3 qualifications are likely to be publicly funded alongside A levels and T Levels, and bring clarity on the timescales. I recommend that you take a look at this for detailed . I believe the Department for Education will be running some webinars to look at some of this in detail, which may be useful for colleagues here as well. As part of the process that awarding organisations are going through, re-applying for funding, we, Ofqual, are contributing by providing qualitative feedback to the DfE on each qualification where funding is being reapplied for, as well as on the awarding organisation itself. This means that these qualifications are coming under much greater individual regulatory scrutiny than has been the case up to now. Ofqual has put in place a range of higher expectations relating to quality that we expect awarding organisations to meet in their reapplications. It is against those expectations that we provide our qualitative feedback to the DfE and the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education IfATE . As the process plays out, the DfE is taking decisions on funding for the reapplications it receives taking into consideration the quality-based advice Ofqual provides, as well as the contribution of IfATE, that represents the employer voice. It is probably important to flag that the government absolutely recognises that, alongside the aim of simplifying the landscape, there will, in the future, still need to be a range of qualifications at L3 available alongside A levels and T Levels. For many students these qualifications are important, not only as vehicles for their continued education and engagement in education, but also because they provide important routes for study or employment. So there will likely be many decisions to approve applications for funding, alongside decisions not to continue to fund. You might be wondering what this means for you as a college leader. In short, unless you are a college which offers only A levels and GCSEs, or T Levels, it is almost certain you will be offering some of these qualifications, maybe for example level 3 BTECs or equivalent. It is also at least possible that the government will determine that some of those qualifications do not meet the criteria for continued funding, which may mean you will need to take decisions about changing the portfolio of courses you provide in the interests of your students to reflect what is available and funded in the future. So following this process, including through your representatives in this association, to make sure that you are up to speed with decisions being taken is critically important. I am sure you will also continue to make your views heard. Grading in 2023 Moving on now, I will now say something about arrangements for grading GCSEs, AS and A levels in 2023. We published our plans back in September so that higher education institutions could factor in decisions that were being made about grading before they embarked on their offer-making, and of course because some of you will have been arriving at UCAS predictions for students. We felt it was important you had as much as possible before you started that process. Our plans for 2023 take us a step on the road to normality, building on what happened in 2022, while also recognising the impact of the pandemic. You will recall that in summer 2022, we aimed for a staging post on the way back to normal grading. In 2023, we will return to pre-pandemic grading, but with some protection in place for your students, a soft landing, if you like. Students in the 2023 cohort have not, during their exam courses, experienced the level of national school or college closures experienced by students in the 2 years before them. But I know, from listening to teachers, college leaders and students themselves, that many have certainly experienced some level of disruption. So, to achieve that extra bit of protection, Ofqual will put in place the same sort of safeguards used for the first students taking reformed GCSEs and A levels from 2017 onwards. Back in the reform context, that meant not disadvantaging students in the first cohorts if overall they performed less well because they were the first to sit the new exams. So how will it work this summer? In practice, as in any year, grade boundaries for every specification will be set by senior examiners after they have reviewed the work produced by students in their exams. But those senior examiners will be guided in their decisions about where to set grade boundaries by about the grades achieved in pre-pandemic years, along with prior attainment data for the cohort. So that means students in 2023 will be protected in grading terms if their examination performance in 2023 is a little lower than it might have been had the pandemic not taken place. That is what I mean by a soft landing. What that means is, a typical student who would have achieved an A grade in their A level geography before the pandemic will be just as likely to get an A in summer 2023, even if their performance in the assessments is a little weaker in 2023 than it might have been before the pandemic. We expect that overall results in summer 2023 will be much closer to the pre-pandemic years than results since 2020. In other words, we expect that overall, nationally, results in 2023 will be lower than they were in 2022. Individual providers, including colleges and schools, should be prepared for this. I know, as a school leader myself, it s worrying if you look at figures that are lower than the previous year. It s important that we don t compare the results in 2022 with any other year. Lower results in 2023 compared with 2022 will not mean, by itself, that your college s performance has fallen. It will be much likely to reflect the return nationally to normal grading standards. It is important to note that, while we aim to return pretty much to normal grading in 2023, this does not mean there is any nationally pre-determined quota of grades. Every set of grade boundaries, qualification by qualification, is determined by human, senior examiners, taking account of all the they have available, including actual student performance. I did want to sound one note of caution: if you are using summer or autumn 2022 papers as mock or trial exams, the grade boundaries set for those papers are likely to be generous, reflecting the approach we took in 2022, both summer and autumn. Do bear that in mind if you are using the results from mocks to give indicative grades for students being examined this year. For vocational and technical qualifications VTQs taken alongside or instead of GCSEs and A levels, awarding organisations are expected to take account of the grading approach being used in GCSEs and A levels. So for VTQ qualifications certificating in 2023, this also means a return to normal grading arrangements. And a word about universities and higher education: decisions about grading by themselves have no effect on the number of higher education places available. That is determined by other factors and has got nothing to do with grading decisions. Universities themselves will take account of how exams will be graded when they make their offers, including any differences between the 4 nations of the UK which already exist . Universities are well-experienced in factoring those in to their offering arrangements. UCAS wrote out to all schools just after Ofqual announced our grading decision, to explain how offers will be made this year, and to confirm that universities would take our grading decision into account. The Chief Regulator also wrote to admissions officers just before Christmas. Formulae equation sheets, MFL and resilience points on 2023: there are one or two changes to support students taking GCSEs. Students will be given formulae sheets for GCSE maths and revised equation sheets for GCSE physics and combined science, which we did in 2022 for those GCSEs. This will give some additional reassurance to GCSE students in the exam itself. And for modern foreign languages GCSEs, Ofqual s changed requirements mean that exams do not have to test unfamiliar vocabulary. That s to make it feel a bit accessible for students this year. Delivering exams Turning now to resilience, the arrangements in place should the unthinkable happen in summer 2023. Clearly the closer we get to the summer, the less likely that becomes, but we ve all learned to be cautious in how we predict the future. In November, Ofqual and the DfE jointly published guidance on resilience, in the very unlikely event that exams are not able to go ahead as planned. Some colleges may be running mock exams now and I know this is a big operation, particularly in colleges such as yours with large cohorts of students. You are also, simultaneously, preparing students to take their end of year exams. Ofqual was conscious of this when we published the guidance. The thrust of that guidance, designed to minimise the burden on you and your students, is that any assessment opportunities you plan should be in line with your normal approaches, as far as possible. As well as all the work you do to prepare your students to take their assessments through your teaching and learning, we know that the administration and delivery of exams is something you take seriously. We take our hats off to people in colleges leading the examinations operation. It is enormously complex, but there is training and support available, and I encourage you to make sure those who are charged with doing this work get access to the range of training available for them so they can benefit from it and deliver as well as possible on behalf of students. If you ve looked at the GCSE and A level exam timetables for next year, you ll see there are some changes from 2022. The Joint Council for Qualifications JCQ listened to feedback about the spacing between exams in the same subject in summer 2022. They have taken this on board for 2023. They will largely be preserving those gaps, to reduce the risk of students missing all exams in a subject, but the spacing between some papers is slightly less next summer. I did just want to draw your attention to the contingency days that they have built in. Both the 8 and 15 June will be contingency afternoons and the 28 June will be a contingency day in case there is national or local disruption that would mean exams had to be re-scheduled. Do please let your students know about this and remind them that they might have to be available on those dates. It s particularly important for them to be aware if they are planning holidays. There are details on the JCQ website, and a quick plug for Ofqual s resources as well: every year we provide a guide for students and a guide for schools and colleges. These will be published in the spring, and always live somewhere central on our website. I hope you ll be able to point your students to them. Vocational and technical qualification results in 2023 And finally, just as Ofqual regulates in the interests of students of all ages and apprentices, we are also convinced of the need for parity of treatment for students across the different sorts of qualifications your colleges provide, whether vocational or academic. So I wanted to reassure you that we have in train a series of actions to prevent a repeat of the delayed results in vocational and technical qualifications that we saw last August. I know this affected some of you and your students. We were shocked by what became apparent in August. Not only that around 20,000 students from 1,550 centres had delayed results, but that for some time, there hadn t been a single date by which VTQ students could expect results even when they were used for progression. That is not acceptable and Ofqual will work with the sector to fix this, not just for this summer, but for the long term and in the interests of being fair to students taking these qualifications. Our investigation of the awarding organisations involved continues, as does our review of the extent of the problem. We will consider whether enforcement action is appropriate after that concludes. In December, we published the 5 key actions that Ofqual, working with you and others in the sector, will deliver. These actions cover a range of areas, and there isn t time to cover them in detail here. They include putting in place clear deadlines, improving data sharing, introducing check-ins for colleges and awarding organisations, improving accessibility about these qualifications, improving communications from awarding organisations to centres, improving training for staff running exams, and monitoring the implementation of all this via a joint taskforce from around the sector chaired by the Chief Regulator. We are certain that taken together these actions will to a very significant extent address the issues we saw playing out this summer and which to a greater or lesser extent have been endemic in the system . Thank you very much for your attention I think we still have a few moments for any questions. Updates to this Explore the topic Education, training and skills', 'New stepping stone resit qualifications, V-levels, a 16 to 19 funding review and an education auto-enrolment from school will all be introduced under the government s skills white paper. Ministers published the policy paper yesterday, alongside a consultation on how proposed new V-levels would work. Here s everything school leaders need to know The government has launched aconsultationon its plans for newV-level coursesas well as the expansion of T-levels and sweeping reforms to level 2 courses, including the end of the T-level foundation year. Ministers have taken aim at the significant variability in assessment, grading and content of current vocational qualifications available to young people. The government s answer V-levels will sit alongside A-levels and T-levels and offer a vocational alternative to these academic and technical routes for students who want to explore different sectors before deciding where to specialise . V-levels will be regulated by Ofqual in a similar way to A-levels. Awarding organisations will have strict rules to follow about the design of qualifications, including how they re structured, how students should be assessed and how they should be graded. A grading scale for V-levels wasn t proposed, but it should be consistent across all of the qualifications, like A-levels and T-levels. There are currently sixdifferent gradingscales for level 3 applied general qualifications. V-levels will also be a similar size to A-levels, 360 guided learning hours, with the intention being that students can mix and match between the two. But they will have an increased proportion of non-exam assessment compared to their academic cousins, some of which can be marked by providers. The size difference between V-levels and T-levels means the former will be broader, subject-based qualifications rather than occupationally specialised. A proposed list of 19 proposed subjects for V-levels was published in the consultation. It includes arts, craft and design; criminology; education and early years; hair, beauty and aesthetics; protective services; retail and travel and tourism. The plan is for the first V-level classes to start in September 2027, but the full roll out will take four years. The consultation also sets out a defunding timetable for qualifications facing the axe. Small qualifications that were due to be defunded in 2026 or 2027 will now be funded until the relevant V-level has been introduced. It means providers can continue to offer small unreformed qualifications or the replacement alternative academic qualifications AAQs or technical occupational qualification TOQs . Students aiming for a large qualification should do a T-level, the consultation stressed. Courses of 720 or guided learning hours in T-level subject areas will continue to have their funding removed in 2026 and 2027, as previously announced. Qualifications of between 421 and 719 guided learning hours will have their funding retained until the corresponding V-level has been introduced. James Kewin, deputy chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association that leads the Protect Student Choice campaign, said the government s confirmation that medium and large AGQs will be defunded will leave a large qualifications gap . He told sister title FE Week the campaign previously published a report that showed tens of thousands of students would be left without a pathway to higher education or skilled employment if the government did not reverse its ban on diploma and extended diploma size AGQs in subjects where there is a T-level. The consultation document published today is clear that the government will not reverse this ban. As a result, colleges and schools will not be able to enrol students on well-respected AGQs in subjects such as health and social care, applied science and IT next year. That will leave a significant qualification gap, particularly as the government s new V levels will not be available until 2027 at the earliest. Kewin said it was unclear how scrapping AGQs before alternatives are in place will help the government break down barriers to opportunity, adding: This decision will also come as unwelcome news for BTEC teachers in colleges and schools, and the huge number of employers that value these qualifications so highly. The DfE s consultation said the strong performance of T-levels warrants expansion into subjects. It proposes not only new subjects, but also new specialisms within existing T-levels. New T-level subjects could also be in areas where occupational standards are not currently set at level 3, such as music technology, production arts and visual effects, and in subjects where there are level 3 qualifications but no corresponding occupational standards, such as music performance and art and design. Like V-levels, the government has set an ambition to begin introducing new T-levels on rolling basis from academic year 2027. But theT-level foundation year programmewill be replaced as part of sweeping reforms to level 2 provision. While much of the attention has been on level 3 qualifications, the white paper acknowledges limited progress has been made on reforming level 2 qualifications for young people. Like the level 3 space, DfE believes there are too many qualifications available, which is confusing for students and difficult for providers and awarding organisations to deliver . DfE s proposed solution is to offer two study programme led pathways for post-16 level 2 students. The first will be known as a study pathway . This will eventually replace the T-level foundation year, which hassuffered from high drop out and poor progression rates. This one-year pathway will be for students who wish to progress to level 3 apprenticeships, A-levels, V-levels or T-levels. Students on this pathway will work towards qualifications called foundation certificates. The second is a two-year occupational pathway for students progressing to employment in level 2 roles, including an apprenticeship. Leavers will achieve qualifications called occupational certificated. Both pathways will require learning towards GCSE English and maths where it s required. The occupational pathway will include an occupational standard-linked technical qualification, and has been proposed to be a two-year programme in part to ensure students can t leave education before they turn 18 and to give time to achieve a GCSE English and maths pass. Like V-levels, foundation certificates and occupational certificates will be rolled out gradually from 2027. As per this summer s spending review, the government will provide 1.2 billion of additional investment per year in skills by 2028-2029 . The white paper said this significant investment will ensure there is increased funding to colleges and other 16 to 19 providers to maintain real terms per-student funding in the next academic year to respond to the demographic increase in 16 to 19-year-olds . Ministers believe this funding boost will help colleges with the recruitment and retention of expert teachers in high value subject areas . Officials will also undertake a 16 to 19 funding formula review to maximise the impact of this funding . A revised formula is expected to be in place for the 2027-28 academic year. We will look at how we are supporting high-value courses to ensure sufficient funding is reaching the most critical subject areas, for example those linked to priority sectors. We will aim to simplify the formula, whilst ensuring we support courses that drive economic growth and support providers to offer provision that will help young people to thrive in areas with growth potential. The government appeared to criticise colleges for entering unprepared students for GCSE English and maths resits. The white paper said too few learners with low prior attainment a grade 2 or below in English and maths are achieving a grade 4 by the time they leave education at age 18 or 19 yet are resitting, sometimes repeatedly, when they are not ready . Each student that failed to achieve a grade 4 pass in English or maths at school must study towards the subjects as a condition of their post-16 place being funded. Government guidance makes clear this is a study requirement, not a requirement for students to resit an exam. The government said it will introduce a new 16 to 19 English and maths preparation for GCSE level 1 qualifications designed to consolidate the foundational skills and knowledge needed to prepare lower prior attaining students grade 2 or below before they then take a GCSE resit . These new qualifications will build on Professor Becky Francis curriculum and assessment review s analysis of the evidence and developing recommendations . Officials will work closely with the sector as we develop the new qualifications and plan to consult in 2026 . Young people leaving school at 16 without an education or training place will also now be auto-enroled into provision, the white paper has revealed. The move comes as part of a range of measures outlined in the white paper to cut the rising numbers of young people not in education, employment or training NEET . Pilots will test the idea of designating a default provider in an area, which could be a college or other provider. They would contact and place a school leaver who hadn t selected a post-16 option. A process would also be put in place for young people that drop-out in-year. Our ambition is that the default for any young person who isn t sure of their next steps post-16 is to be in a college or education provider, rather than out of education and training, the white paper said. Funding for education and wraparound support is yet to be determined. Other anti-NEET measures in the white paper include improving data sharing and tracking of young people between schools, local authorities and education providers. New risk of NEET indicators will be introduced using artificial intelligence to enhance this approach . Schools will be asked to do to help young people at risk of becoming NEET successfully transition into post-16 education and training which will be monitored by Ofsted. The white paper rehashes the government s announcements from last month s Labour party conference around tackling soaring numbers of young people who are NEET its new youth guarantee . But it also reveals plans for the government to track student attendance in all 16 to 19 providers. This will enable providers and the government intervene early when attendance starts to decline to try and prevent the young person from becoming NEET. Officials will take the best practice from school attendance tracking and bring it into education, to identify those at risk of becoming NEET through data sharing and embedded strategies to address persistent absence .']",Qualifications reform and T Levels

To find out , visitPupil wellbeing packages for schools and academies Endsleigh When it comes to mental health, early intervention is key to improving the quality of a child s home and family life. Supporting children can help them perform better at school, improve their long-term outcomes, and help them develop strengths and skills that prepare them for university and adult life. School-based interventions have evidence of improving not only pupils wellbeing but also their mental health and behaviour and have been shown to improve outcomes including resilience and self-esteem, reduce anxiety or depressive symptoms, and prevent violent and aggressive behaviour. Addressing mental health concerns early on have also been shown to improve academic achievement.Research showsthat children with stronger social and emotional skills are likely to graduate from college or university, to succeed in their careers, have positive work and family relationships, have good mental and physical health, and to become engaged citizens. Early intervention makes a difference Endsleigh s Pupil Assistance Programme has been developed in partnership with Health Assured, the UK and Ireland s most trusted independent health and wellbeing specialist and the only BACP-accredited provider at organisational level. Kayleigh Frost, Head of Clinical Support at Health Assured explains why early intervention in schools is so important. Many school age children don t know how to ask for help. They don t know how to articulate the emotions they might be feeling and because many adults either aren t attuned to such nuanced approaches or feel uncomfortable talking about emotions, it s easy to brush off or invalidate what could be a cry for help. We need to talk about our mental health and not shy away from coming forward with our challenges. The issues still seem to come from adults. They get scared that they re going to say the wrong thing or that they re going to offend the person. That s why services like Endsleigh s Pupil Assistance Programme are so valuable. When a young person feels empowered to speak up there s someone they can talk to who can support them with whatever they need. It s a jigsaw with many pieces that need to fit together. Caregivers need to learn to open up conversations with younger people so that talking about mental health doesn t become a taboo subject. It may not be something that comes naturally, so that s just as important to address as is access to professional support when it s needed. Normalising how important it is to talk about if you re sad, or if you re angry because when you re young you don t necessarily understand what anxiety is, but you can feel sad and you can feel angry and you can feel upset and it s about opening up those conversations, . Stepping out of your comfort zone Teachers, parents, guardians, and caregivers need to step out of their comfort zone and provide the right environment to help empower young people to speak up. Charities like Young Minds has lots of practical advice and tips on how to encourage your child to open up about their feelings, and services such as Endsleigh s Pupil Assistance Programme provides access to professional support and advice for teachers, parents, and caregivers. Sadly, communication between adults and young people is only part of the problem. Long waiting times for professional mental health support means the help isn t there when needed. It can be months and months before you can access help via the NHS and that depends if you meet certain thresholds, . If you have what they determine to be low level depression or anxiety but are high functioning, it s unlikely you ll be offered support. But these are the people that are really at risk of developing serious mental health conditions. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services CAMHS provided by the NHS for example, I think the waiting list goes up to 24 months in some areas and to qualify you might have to be at severe level. It also depends on where you live, some areas are affluent and so access to support is a lot easier. Young people who have learned the tools they need to cope with pressures, may find it easier to transition from school to university and from university to work life. While trauma you experience as a young person will not be the same as traumas you may face as an adult, it s easier to retain when you re younger. Your brain has the capacity to absorb and be receptive to the skills you learn through counselling that will help you in later life. Endsleigh is passionate about supporting schools to manage their risks and provide safer environments for children and employees, whether it be through our wellbeing services, risk management and commercial insurances, or by protecting your finances and data through cyber security. In a recent webinar we talk about risk management and providing a holistic approach to school wellbeing. Please click on the image to find out . You can find on our Pupil Assistance Programmehereor email us', 'The government should create a national network of wellbeing supervisors in state and independent schools to provide one-to-one personal support for staff with mental health responsibilities, a coalition of leaders has said. The Coalition for Youth Mental Health in Schools also called for mandated national waiting time standards for all child and adolescent mental health services, a greater element of mental health training in teacher education and a national survey of youth mental health. It comes asanalysis by the Education Policy Institutefound that of 135 government policies introduced since 2015 to boost youth mental health, just 36 per cent have been fully implemented. ASchools Weekinvestigation last yearrevealed how schools had thousands of pupils stuck on waiting lists to access mental health support, with trusts instead funding provision from their own pockets or saying they cannot afford to help. And a report from the children s commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza earlier this yearfound a third of children referred to mental health services last year did not receive treatment, prompting calls for quicker rollout of school support amid fears existing services can t cope. Members of the coalition include leaders from academy trusts Star Academies, Oasis Community Learning and Reach Academy Feltham, as well as representatives of private institutions such as Alleyn s school, Eton College and St Paul s. The groupreleased a report in 2021, highlighting difficulties facing young people in the wake of the pandemic and calling for urgent action. Calls, the coalition said, that have gone unanswered . Vulnerable students are still being let down by delays in the system and insufficient availability of care , they said in their report. And while there is a colossal effort underway in schools to tackle these challenges, there are still too many hurdles for too many pupils when it comes to accessing mental health support. The group looked at approaches to mental health in participating schools and other settings to find out how schools making the very best of what is available to them are tackling the crisis . But while our research demonstrates how schools-based interventions can have a positive impact, we must stress that these measures should not preclude access to child and adolescent mental health services in the community. They warned the state of mental health provision has reached a tipping point . We are keen that no teacher or school finds themselves unsupported when it comes to protecting their children s mental health. The report called for a national network of wellbeing supervisors to support schools staff with mental health responsibilities. Their work would be different from clinical supervision of a personal check-in and opportunity to ask how they are coping, rather than caseload management . Such support would have to external, at least from another school, and detached from any line management responsibilities . Oasis director of safeguarding Jon Needham said they were seeing a significant increase in the number of children who need support, and a worrying decrease in the resources available to them, all within a fractured system that is too difficult for most to navigate . It cannot be for schools alone to fix this problem, it calls for all parts of society, families, local authorities, government, health services and charities to work together to give every young person the support they need, when they need it. And Sir Hamid Patel, chief executive of Star Academies, said schools did exceptional work to support pupils who are struggling with their mental health, but there is only so much education providers can do alone . In the wake of the pandemic, waiting times are growing at the exact time when the need is greatest. There needs to be a much greater focus from government on youth mental health services to ensure every young person has the opportunity to thrive. The coalition also said teacher education should include a greater element of mental health training . There should also be mandated national waiting time standards for all CAMHS, and a new national survey drawing on the success of the BeeWell pilot in Manchester. The report also said schools and trusts should consider a caught and taught approach to mental health and wellbeing in the curriculum. Caught approaches involve fostering a sense of belonging and actively encouraging the development of social and emotional skills. Taught approaches involve the explicit teaching of skills relating to emotional health and wellbeing, such as through PSHE lessons.', 'Almost one million young people will get access to school mental health support this year. Does that mean the government is deliveringits pledges?Schools Weektakes a look The government pledged to provide access to mental health professionals in every school so every young person has access to early support to address problems before they escalate . TheDepartment for Educationtoday said half of all schools now have access to a mental health support team MHST . Funding of 49 million will enable the teams to reach 60 per cent of schools an extra 900,000 pupils by March next year. Rollout will be prioritised based on NHS identification of local need to reach the most vulnerable children first. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said expanding support was one of the single biggest steps we can take to improve children s life chances, make sure all pupils are getting the very most out of school and deliver excellence for every child . However, the government said it would not reach its pledge to reach every school until 2029-30 the end of parliament. MHSTs are made up of specialists trained by the NHS. They aim to identify and tackle mental health issues early on, using interventions from group sessions to build children s resilience to 1:1s helping to manage anxiety . But Place2Be, the children s mental health charity, said the teams were really only one part of the solution. Alone, they won t be enough to truly meet the government s manifesto commitment nor effectively tackle the mental health difficulties facing young people today. It was also vital that young people could also access high-quality, targeted clinical support at their school . Labour pledged to recruit an additional 8,500 new staff to help treat both children and adults. There have been no details about the timeline. A damning report by the British Medical Association BMA published last June, the month before Labour took office, highlighted the declining state of England s mental health workforce. It had seen little growth in the past decade, while the number of people using mental health services had soared 21 per cent since 2016. NHS England figures show the hospital and community health services HCHS mental health workforce remained at about 109,000 between 2013 and 2017. But it has climbed steeply in recent years and was at 157,000 in December. Nurses and health visitors made up most of the increase. But Dr Andrew Molodynski, the BMA s mental health policy lead, said the rise was nowhere near fast enough to meet the sharp rise in demand for children s mental health services. Andy Bell, the chief executive at the Centre for Mental Health, said 8,500 workers could end up being a slower rate of increase than the past five years . The government said new mental health support team workers would form part of this figure. Stephen Kinnock, the health minister, said in January that the staff on the teams must have at least a level three vocational qualification, or equivalent level of relevant study . But Dr Sebastien Chapleau, an assistant director of Citizens UK, said this fell below what was needed to support those who would otherwise end up on CAMHS waiting lists. Teams should feature professionally trained counsellors who could offer a greater depth of support, the group said this week in letter to Bridget Phillipson. In its election manifesto, Labour said waiting lists for mental health support were too high , and shamefully so for young people. The party pledged to bring waiting times down and intervene earlier . A lack of public data makes progress unclear. The children s commissioner is due to publish her annual report on the state of children s mental health services this weekend. The report presents a mixed picture for children seeking mental health support, said a spokesperson, with waiting times remaining an issue for thousands of children . However, data in the commissioner s report will only go up to April 2024, before Labour took office. YoungMinds analysis of NHS England data showed a 52 per cent increase in young people waiting than a year for CAMHS support rising from 51,866 in 2022-23, to 78,577 in 2023-24. Olly Parker, the head of external affairs at YoungMinds, said many young people still face long waits while their mental health deteriorates . Labour pledged to create a new national network of Young Futures hubs, which would tackle knife crime and rising mental health issues by providing open access mental health services. Lauded last year as a major prevention-focused reform rather than a sticking plaster , Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said there would be a targeted programme in every area. The hubs would be open to young people aged 11 to 24, providing early intervention through drop-in services. In March, Youth Access said there were over 60 of the hubs across the country, but they were not yet universally available . It estimated 169 to 210 million of annual funding was needed to roll out a hub in every local area , with an extra 74 to 121 million needed for set-up costs. It urged the government to commit to a multi-year funding package in the upcoming spending review. Neither the DfE nor health department responded to Schools Week s question about how many hubs are now open, how many are planned, and the roll-out timeline. Meanwhile, critics have said asking young people to access mental health support outside schools was a recipe for disaster . Chapleau said he feared young people won t go and that it was much better to integrate things within school . Phillipson said the government was already turning the tide on the mental health crisis after inheriting a system full of challenges . Mental health took a major hit during the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly among young people. An NHS England study in 2023 found 21 per cent of 8 to 16-year-olds had a probable mental health problem seven percentage points higher than in 2017. Meanwhile, cuts to services have left schools shouldering the burden. A Teacher Tapp poll of than 2,600 teachers last year found 84 per cent were spending an increasing amount of time helping pupils with mental health issues. A DfE study published this week has also suggested a causal link between mental ill health and children missing school. The government has committed to investing an extra 680 million in mental health services, with a health department spokesperson pledging that every child should have access to mental health support . They also said the world s first 24 7 mental health crisis support services had been launched. Through our Plan for Change, we will raise the healthiest generation of children in our history by reforming the NHS to give mental health the same attention and focus as physical health.']",
