RATIONALE:
This baseline reflects a stabilised configuration following minimal document-level
cleaning and exploratory diagnostic runs. Light tuning of the clustering parameters
was applied to balance topic granularity and stability, while a fixed UMAP random
state ensures reproducibility across runs. Topic representation was refined using a
stopword-filtered vectorizer to improve interpretability without altering document
embeddings, clustering, or topic assignments. This configuration provides a
defensible reference point for evaluation and comparison with alternative models.
